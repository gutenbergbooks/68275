<h2 class="nobreak">TO YOU AT THE GATE.</h2>
</div>


<p>There was a daisy-meadow, that flowed brimming to the
stone wall at the roadside, and on the wooded crest beyond
a lamp twinkled in a house round which stole softly the
unhurried, eddyless dusk. You stood at the gate, your arms
folded on the top bar, your face uplifted, watching the stars
and the young moon of June. I was not so old but that I
marked your gown of white, your dark head, your eyes like
the blue of mid-ocean sea-water in the shadow of marching
billows. As my step sounded you looked up startled, a little
disdainful, maybe; then you smiled gravely; but a certain
dejection of attitude, a sweet wistfulness of lips and eyes,
arrested and touched me; and I stole on guiltily, for who
was I to intrude upon a picture so perfect, to which moon
and stars were glad contributors? As I reached the crown
of the road, where it dipped down to a brook that whispered
your name, I paused and looked back, and you waved your
hand as though dismissing me to the noisy world of men.</p>

<p>In other Junes I have kept tryst with moon and stars
beside your gate, where daisies flow still across the meadow,
and insect voices blur the twilight peace; but I have never
seen again your house of shadows among the trees, or found
you dreaming there at the gate with uplifted face and wistful
eyes. But from the ridge, where the road steals down into
the hollow with its fireflies and murmuring water, I for ever
look back to the star- and moon-hung gate in the wall, and
see your slim, girlish figure, and can swear that you wave
your hand.</p>

<small>TWO GENTLEMEN SAY GOOD-BYE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“IF anything really interesting should happen to me
I think I should drop dead,” declared Ardmore,
as he stood talking to Griswold in the railway station
at Atlanta. “I entered upon this life under false pretenses,
thinking that money would make the game easy,
but here I am, twenty-seven years old, stalled at the
end of a blind alley, with no light ahead; and to be
quite frank, old man, I don’t believe you have the advantage
of me. What’s the matter with us, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“The mistake we make,” replied Griswold, “is in failing
to seize opportunities when they offer. You and I
have talked ourselves hoarse a thousand times planning
schemes we never pull off. We are cursed with indecision,
that’s the trouble with us. We never see the
handwriting on the wall, or if we do, it’s just a streak
of hieroglyphics, and we don’t know what it means until
we read about it in the newspapers. But I thought you
were satisfied with the thrills you got running as a reform
candidate for alderman in New York last year.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
It was a large stage, and the lime-light struck you pretty
often. Didn’t you get enough? No doubt they’d be
glad to run you again.”</p>

<p>Ardmore glanced hastily about and laid his hand
heavily on his friend’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it—don’t think of it! No more politics
in mine. The world may go hang if it waits for
me to set it right. What I want is something different,
a real adventure—something with spice in it. I have
bought everything money can buy, and now I’m looking
for something that can’t be tagged with a price.”</p>

<p>“There’s your yacht and the open sea,” suggested
Griswold.</p>

<p>“Sick of it! Sick to death of it!”</p>

<p>“You’re difficult, old man, and mighty hard to please.
Why don’t you turn explorer and go in for the North
Pole?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly bully! I’ve thought of it a lot, but I want
to be sure I’ve cleaned up everything else first. It’s
always up there waiting—on ice, so to speak—but when
it’s done once there will be nothing left. I want to save
that for the last call.”</p>

<p>“You said about the same thing when we talked of
Thibet that first evening we met at the University Club,
and now the Grand Lama sings in all the phonographs,
and for a penny you can see him in a kinetoscope, eating
his luncheon. I remember very well that night. We
were facing each other at a writing-table, and you
looked up timidly from your letter and asked me whether
there were two <i>g’s</i> in aggravate; and I answered that
it depended on the meaning—one <i>g</i> for a mild case,
two for a severe one—and you laughed, and we began
talking. Then we found out how lonesome we both
were, and you asked me to dinner, and then took me
to that big house of yours up there in Fifth Avenue
and showed me the pictures in your art gallery, and we
found out that we needed each other.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Yes, I had needed you all right!” And Ardmore
sniffed dolefully, and complained of the smoke that was
drifting in upon them from the train sheds. “I wish
you wouldn’t always be leaving me. You ought to give
up your job and amuse me. You’re the only chap I
know who doesn’t talk horse or automobile or yacht, or
who doesn’t want to spend whole evenings discussing
champagne vintages; but you’re too good a man to be
wasted on a college professorship. Better let me endow
an institution that will make you president—there might
be something in that.”</p>

<p>“It would make me too prominent, so that when we
really make up our minds to go in for adventures I
should be embarrassed by my high position. As a
mere lecturer on ‘The Libelling of Sunken Ships’ in a
law school, I’m the most obscure person in the world.
And for another thing, we couldn’t risk the scandal of
tainted money. It would be nasty to have your great-grandfather’s
whisky deals with the Mohawk Indians
chanted in a college yell.”</p>

<p>The crowd surged past them to the Washington express,
and a waiting porter picked up Griswold’s bags.</p>

<p>“Wish you wouldn’t go. I have three hours to wait,”
said Ardmore, looking at his watch, “and the only
Atlanta man I know is out of town.”</p>

<p>“What did you say you were going to New Orleans
for?” demanded Griswold, taking out his ticket and
moving towards the gate. “I thought you exhausted
the Creole restaurants long ago.”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” faltered Ardmore, colouring, “I’m looking
for some one.”</p>

<p>“Out with it—out with it!” commanded his friend.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for a girl I saw from a car window day
before yesterday. I had started north, and my train
stopped to let a south-bound train pass somewhere in
North Carolina. The girl was on the south-bound
sleeper, and her window was opposite mine. She put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
aside the magazine she was reading and looked me over
rather coolly.”</p>

<p>“And you glanced carelessly in the opposite direction
and pulled down your shade, of course, like the well-bred
man you are——” interrupted Griswold, holding
fast to Ardmore’s arm as they walked down the platform.</p>

<p>“I did no such thing. I looked at her and she looked
at me. And then my train started——”</p>

<p>“Well, trains have a way of starting. Does the
romance end here?”</p>

<p>“Then, just at the last moment, she winked at me!”</p>

<p>“It was a cinder, Ardy. The use of soft coal on railways
is one of the saddest facts of American transportation.
I need hardly remind you, Mr. Ardmore, that nice
girls don’t wink at strange young men. It isn’t done!”</p>

<p>“I would have you know, Professor, that this girl is a
lady.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so irritable, and let me summarize briefly
on your own hypothesis. You stared at a strange girl,
and she winked at you, safe in the consciousness that she
would never see you again. And now you are going to
New Orleans to look for her. She will probably meet
you at the station, with her bridesmaids and wedding
cake all ready for you. And you think this will lead to
an adventure—you defer finding the North Pole for this—for
this? Poor Ardy! But did she toss her card
from the window? Why New Orleans? Why not Minneapolis,
or Bangor, Maine?”</p>

<p>“I’m not an ass, Grissy. I caught the name of the
sleeper—you know they’re all named, like yachts and
tall buildings—the name of her car was the <i>Alexandra</i>.
I asked our conductor where it was bound for, and he
said it was the New Orleans car. So I took the first
train back, ran into you here, and that’s the whole
story to date.”</p>

<p>“I admire your spirit. New Orleans is much pleasanter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
than the polar ice, and a girl with a winking eye
isn’t to be overlooked in this vale of tears. What did
this alleviating balm for tired eyes look like, if you
remember anything besides the wicked wink?”</p>

<p>“She was bareheaded, and her hair was wonderfully
light and fluffy, and it was parted in the middle and tied
behind with a black ribbon in a great bow. She rested
her cheek on her hand—her elbow on the window-sill,
you know—and she smiled a little as the car moved off,
and winked—do you understand? Her eyes were blue,
Grissy, big and blue—and she was perfectly stunning.”</p>

<p>“There are winks and winks, Ardy,” observed Griswold,
with a judicial air. “There is the wink inadvertent,
to which no meaning can be attached. There is
the wink deceptive, usually given behind the back of a
third person, and a vulgar thing which we will not
associate with your girl of the <i>Alexandra</i>. And then,
to be brief, there is the wink of mischief, which is observed
occasionally in persons of exceptional bringing
up. There are moments in the lives of all of us when
we lose our grip on conventions—on morality, even.
The psychology of this matter is very subtle. Here you
are, a gentleman of austerely correct life; here is a
delightful girl, on whom you flash in an out-of-the-way
corner of the world. And she, not wholly displeased
by the frank admiration in your eyes—for you may as
well concede that you stared at her——”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I did look at her,” admitted Ardmore
reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Pardonably, no doubt, just as you would look at a
portrait in a picture gallery, of course. This boarding-school
miss, who had never before lapsed from absolute
propriety, felt the conventional world crumble beneath
her as the train started. She could no more have resisted
the temptation to wink than she could have refused
a caramel or an invitation to appear as best girl
at a church wedding. Thus wireless communication is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
established between soul and soul for an instant only,
and then you are cut off for ever. Perhaps, in the next
world, Ardy——”</p>

<p>Griswold and Ardmore had often idealized themselves
as hopeless pursuers of the elusive, the unattainable, the
impossible; or at least Ardmore had, and Griswold had
entered into the spirit of this sort of thing for the joy it
gave Ardmore. They had discussed frequently the call
of soul to soul—the quick glance passing between perfect
strangers in crowded thoroughfares—and had fruitlessly
speculated as to their proper course in the event the
call seemed imperative. A glance of the eye is one thing,
but it is quite another to address a stranger and offer
eternal friendship. The two had agreed that, while,
soul-call or no soul-call, a gentleman must keep clear
of steamer flirtations, and avoid even the most casual
remarks to strange young women in any circumstances,
a gentleman of breeding and character may nevertheless
follow the world’s long trails in search of a never-to-be-forgotten
face.</p>

<p>The fact is that Ardmore was exceedingly shy, and a
considerable experience of fashionable society had not
diminished this shortcoming. Griswold, on the other
hand, had the Virginian’s natural social instinct, but he
suffered from a widely-diffused impression that much
learning had made him either indifferent or extremely
critical where women are concerned.</p>

<p>Ardmore shrugged his shoulders and fumbled in his
coat pockets as though searching for ideas. An austere
composure marked his countenance at all times, and
emphasized the real distinction of his clean-cut features.
His way of tilting back his head and staring dreamily
into vacancy had established for him a reputation for
stupidity that was wholly undeserved.</p>

<p>“Please limit the discussion to the present world,
Professor.”</p>

<p>When Ardmore was displeased with Griswold he called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
him Professor, in a withering tone that disposed of the
academic life.</p>

<p>“We shall limit it to New Orleans or the universe, as
you like.”</p>

<p>“I’m disappointed in you, Grissy. You don’t take
this matter in the proper spirit. I’m going to find that
girl, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I want you to find her, Ardy, and throw yourself
at her feet. Be it far from me to deprive you of the
joy of search. I thoroughly admire your resolute spirit.
It smacks of the old heroic times. Nor can I conceal
from you my consuming envy. If a girl should flatter
me with a wink, I should follow her thrice round the
world. She should not elude me anywhere in the
Copernican system. If it were not the nobler part for
you to pursue alone, I should forsake my professorship
and buckle on my armour and follow your standard—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">With the winking eye</div>
<div class="verse">For my battle-cry.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And Griswold hummed the words, beating time with
his stick, much to Ardmore’s annoyance.</p>

<p>“In my ignorance,” Griswold continued, “I recall but
one allusion to the wink in immortal song. If my memory
serves me, it is no less a soul than Browning who sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘All heaven, meanwhile, condensed into one eye</div>
<div class="verse">Which fears to lose the wonder, should it wink.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>You seem worried, Ardy. Does the wink press so
heavily, or what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“The fact is, I’m in trouble. My sister says I’ve got
to marry.”</p>

<p>“Which sister?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Atchison. You know Nellie? She’s a nice girl
and she’s a good sister to me, but she’s running me too
hard on this marrying business. She’s going to bring a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
bunch of girls down to Ardsley in a few days, and she
says she’ll stay until I make a choice.”</p>

<p>Griswold whistled.</p>

<p>“Then, as we say in literary circles, you’re up against
it. No wonder you’re beginning to take notice of the
frolicsome boarding-school girl who winks at the world.
I believe I’d rather take chances myself with that amiable
sort than marry into your Newport transatlantic
set.”</p>

<p>“Well, one thing’s certain, Grissy. You’ve got to
come to Ardsley and help me out while those people are
there. Nellie likes you; she thinks you’re terribly intellectual
and all that, and if you’ll throw in a word now
and then, why——”</p>

<p>“Why, I may be able to protect you from the crafts
and assaults of your sister. You seem to forget, Ardy,
that I’m not one of your American leisure class. I’m
always delighted to meet Mrs. Atchison, but I’m a
person of occupations. I have a consultation in Richmond
to-morrow, then me for Charlottesville. We have
examinations coming on, and while I like to play with
you, I’ve positively got to work.”</p>

<p>“Not if I endow all the chairs in the university!
You’ve not only got to come, but you’re going to be
there the day they arrive.”</p>

<p>Thomas Ardmore, of New York and Ardsley, struck
his heavy stick—he always carried a heavy stick—smartly
on the cement platform in the stress of his
feeling. He was much shorter than Griswold, to whom
he was deeply attached—for whom he had, indeed, the
frank admiration of a small boy for a big brother. He
sometimes wondered how fully Griswold entered into
the projects of adventure which he, in his supreme
idleness, planned and proposed; but he himself had
never been quite ready to mount horse or shake out
soil, and what Griswold had said about indecision rankled
in his heart. He was sorry now that he had told of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
this new enterprise to which he had pledged himself,
but he grew lenient towards Griswold’s lack of sympathy
as he reflected that the quest of a winking girl was
rather beneath the dignity of a gentleman wedded not
merely to the law, but to the austere teaching profession
as well. In his heart he forgave Griswold, but he was
all the more resolved to address himself stubbornly to
his pursuit of the deity of the car <i>Alexandra</i>, for only
by finding her could he establish himself in Griswold’s
eyes as a man of action, capable of carrying through a
scheme requiring cleverness and tact.</p>

<p>Ardmore was almost painfully rich, but the usual
diversions of the wealthy did not appeal to him; and
having exhausted foreign travel, he spent much time
on his estate in the North Carolina hills, where he could
ride all day on his own land, and where he read prodigiously
in a huge library that he had assembled with
special reference to works on piracy, a subject that had
attracted him from early youth.</p>

<p>It was this hobby that had sealed his friendship with
Griswold, who had relinquished the practice of law, after
a brilliant start in his native city of Richmond, to accept
the associate professorship of admiralty in the law department
of the University of Virginia. Marine law had
a particular fascination for Griswold, from its essentially
romantic character. As a law student he had read all
the decisions in admiralty that the libraries afforded, and
though faithfully serving the university, he still occasionally
accepted retainers in admiralty cases of unusual
importance. His lectures were constantly attended by
students in other departments of the university for sheer
pleasure in Griswold’s racy and entertaining exposition
of the laws touching the libelling of schooners and the
recovery of jettisoned cargoes. Henry Maine Griswold
was tall, slender, and dark, and he hovered recklessly,
as he might have put it, on the brink of thirty. He
stroked his thin brown moustache habitually, as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
to hide the smile that played about his humorous mouth—a
smile that lay even more obscurely in his fine brown
eyes. He did violence to the academic traditions by
dressing with metropolitan care, gray being his prevailing
note, though his scarfs ventured upon bold colour
schemes that interested his students almost as much
as his lectures. The darkest fact of his life—and one
shared with none—was his experiments in verse. From
his undergraduate days he had written occasionally a
little song, quite for his own pleasure in versifying, and
to a little sheaf of these things in manuscript he still
added a few verses now and then.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Ardy,” he was saying to his friend as
“all aboard” was called, “and don’t be reckless. When
you get through looking for the winking eye, come up
to Charlottesville, and we’ll plan <i>The True Life of Captain
Kidd</i> that is some day going to make us famous.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wire you later,” replied Ardmore, clinging to his
friend’s hand a moment after the train began to move.
Griswold leaned out of the vestibule to wave a last
farewell to Ardmore, and something very kind and gentle
and good to see shone in the lawyer’s eyes. He went
into the car smiling, for he called Ardmore his best
friend, and he was amused by his last words, which were
always Ardmore’s last in their partings, and were followed
usually by telegrams about the most preposterous
things, or suggestions for romantic adventures, or some
new hypothesis touching Captain Kidd and his buried
treasure. Ardmore never wrote letters; he always telegraphed,
and he enjoyed filing long, mysterious, and
expensive messages with telegraph operators in obscure
places where a scrupulous ten words was the frugal limit.</p>

<p>Griswold lighted a cigar and opened the afternoon
Atlanta papers in the smoking compartment. His eye
was caught at once by imperative headlines. It is not
too much to say that the eye of the continent was
arrested that evening by the amazing disclosure, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
tardily reaching the public, that something unusual had
occurred at the annual meeting of the Cotton Planters’
Association at New Orleans on the previous day. Every
copy-reader and editor, every paragrapher on every newspaper
in the land, had smiled and reached for a fresh
pencil as a preliminary bulletin announced the passing
of harsh words between the Governor of North Carolina
and the Governor of South Carolina. It may as well be
acknowledged here that just what really happened at
the Cotton Planters’ Convention will never be known,
for this particular meeting was held behind closed doors;
and as the two governors were honoured guests of the
association, no member has ever breathed a word touching
an incident that all most sincerely deplored. Indeed,
no hint of it would ever have reached the public had it
not been that both gentlemen hurriedly left the convention
hall, refused to keep their appointments to speak at
the banquet that followed the business meetings, and
were reported to have taken the first trains for their
respective capitals. It was whispered by a few persons
that the Governor of South Carolina had taken a fling
at the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration of
Independence; it was rumoured in other quarters that
the Governor of North Carolina was the aggressor, he
having—it was said—declared that a people (meaning
the freemen of the commonwealth of South Carolina)
who were not intelligent enough to raise their own hay,
and who, moreover, bought that article in Ohio, were
not worth the ground necessary for their decent interment.
It is not the purpose of this chronicle either to seek
the truth of what passed between the two governors at
New Orleans, or to discuss the points of history and
agriculture raised in the statements just indicated. As
every one knows, the twentieth of May (or was it the
thirty-first?), 1775, is solemnly observed in North Carolina
as the day on which the patriots of Mecklenburg
County severed the relations theretofore existing between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
them and his Majesty King George the Third.
Equally well known is the fact that in South Carolina
it is an article of religious faith that on that twentieth
day of May, 1775, the citizens of Mecklenburg County,
North Carolina, cheered the English flag and adopted
resolutions reaffirming their ancient allegiance to the
British crown. This controversy and the inadequacy of
the South Carolina hay crop must be passed on to the
pamphleteers, with such other vexed questions as Andrew
Jackson’s birthplace—more debated than Homer’s,
and not to be carelessly conceded to the strutting sons
of Waxhaw.</p>

<p>Griswold read of the New Orleans incident with a
smile, while several fellow-passengers discussed it in a
tone of banter. One of them, a gentleman from Mississippi,
presently produced a flask, which he offered to
the others, remarking, “As the Governor of North Carolina
said to the Governor of South Carolina,” which was,
to be sure, pertinent to the hour and the discussion,
and bristling with fresh significance.</p>

<p>“They were both in Atlanta this morning,” said the
man with the flask, “and they would have been travelling
together on this train if they hadn’t met in the
ticket office and nearly exploded with rage.”</p>

<p>The speaker was suddenly overcome with his own
humour, and slapped his knee and laughed; then they
all laughed, including Griswold.</p>

<p>“One ought to have taken the lower berth and one the
upper to make it perfect,” observed an Alabama man.
“I wonder when they’ll get home.”</p>

<p>“They’ll probably both walk to be sure they don’t
take the same train,” suggested a commercial traveller
from Cincinnati, who had just come from New Orleans.
“Their friends are doing their best to keep them apart.
They both have a reputation for being quick on the
trigger.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” exclaimed Griswold. “I dare say it’s all a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
newspaper story. There’s no knife-and-pistol nonsense
in the South any more. They’ll both go home and
attend to their business, and that will be the last of it.
The people of North Carolina ought to be proud of
Dangerfield; he’s one of the best governors they ever
had. And Osborne is a first-class man, too, one of the
old Palmetto families.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’re both all right,” drawled the Mississippian,
settling his big black hat more firmly on his
head. “Dangerfield spoke in our town at the state fair
last year, and he’s one of the best talkers I ever heard.”</p>

<p>Therefore, as no one appeared to speak for the governor
of South Carolina, the drummer volunteered to vouch
for his oratorical gifts, on the strength of an address
lately delivered by Governor Osborne in a lecture course
at Cincinnati. Being pressed by the Mississippian, he
admitted that he had not himself attended the lecture,
but he had heard it warmly praised by competent critics.</p>

<p>The Mississippian had resented Griswold’s rejection of
the possibility of personal violence between the governors,
and wished to return to the subject.</p>

<p>“It’s not only themselves,” he declared, “but each
man has got the honour of his state to defend. Suppose,
when they met in the railway office at Atlanta this
morning, Dangerfield had drawed his gun. Do you suppose,
gentlemen, that if North Carolina had drawed
South Carolina wouldn’t have followed suit? I declare,
young man, you don’t know what you’re talking about.
If Bill Dangerfield won’t fight, I don’t know fightin’
blood when I see it.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” began the Alabama man, “my brother-in-law
in Charleston went to college with Osborne, and
many’s the time I’ve heard him say that he was sorry
for the man who woke up Charlie Osborne. Charlie—I
mean the governor, you understand—is one of these
fellows who never says much, but when you get him
going he’s terrible to witness. Bill Dangerfield may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Governor of North Car’line, and I reckon he is, but he
ain’t Governor of South Car’line, not by a damned good
deal.”</p>

<p>The discussion had begun to bore Griswold, and he
went back to his own section, having it in mind to revise
a lecture he was preparing on “The Right of Search on
the High Seas.” It had grown dark, and the car was
brilliantly lighted. There were not more than half a
dozen other persons in his sleeper, and these were widely
scattered. Having taken an inventory of his belongings
to be sure they were all at hand, he became conscious of
the presence of a young lady in the opposite section. In
the seat behind her sat an old coloured woman in snowy
cap and apron, who was evidently the young lady’s
servant. Griswold was aware that this dusky duenna
bristled and frowned and pursed her lips in the way of
her picturesque kind as he glanced at her, as though his
presence were an intrusion upon her mistress, who sat
withdrawn to the extreme corner of her section, seeking
its fullest seclusion, with her head against a pillow, and
the tips of her suède shoes showing under her gray
travelling skirt on the farther half of the section. She
twirled idly in her fingers a half-opened white rosebud—a
fact unimportant in itself, but destined to linger long
in Griswold’s memory. The pillow afforded the happiest
possible background for her brown head, her cheek bright
with colour, and a profile clear-cut, and just now—an
impression due, perhaps, to the slight quiver of her
nostrils and the compression of her lips—seemingly disdainful
of the world. Griswold hung up his hat and
opened his portfolio; but the presence of the girl suggested
Ardmore and his ridiculous quest of the alluring
blue eye, and it was refreshing to recall Ardmore and
his ways. Here was one man, at least, in this twentieth
century, at whose door the Time Spirit might thump
and thunder in vain.</p>

<p>The black woman rose and ministered to her mistress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
muttering in kind monotone consolatory phrases from
which “chile” and “honey” occasionally reached Griswold’s
ears. The old mammy produced from a bag
several toilet bottles, a fresh handkerchief, a hand
mirror, and a brush, which she arranged in the empty
seat. The silver trinkets glowed brightly against the
blue upholstery.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Aunt Phœbe, I’m feeling much better.
Just let me alone now, please.”</p>

<p>The girl put aside the white rose for a moment and
breathed deeply of the vinaigrette, whose keen, pungent
odour stole across the aisle to Griswold. She bent forward,
took up the hand mirror, and brushed the hair
away from her forehead with half a dozen light strokes.
She touched her handkerchief to the cologne flask,
passed it across her eyes, and then took up the rose
again and settled back with a little sigh of relief. In
her new upright position her gaze rested upon Griswold’s
newspapers, which he had flung down on the empty half
of his section. One of them had fallen open, and lay
with its outer page staring with the bold grin of display
type.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">TWO GOVERNORS AT WAR.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">What did the Governor of North Carolina say<br />
to the Governor of South Carolina?</span></p>
</div>

<p>The colour deepened in the girl’s face; a slight frown
gathered in her smooth forehead; then she called the
coloured woman, and a brief colloquy followed between
them. In a moment Griswold was addressed in a tone
and manner at once condescending and deferential.</p>

<p>“If yo’ please, suh, would yo’ all ’low my mistus t’
look at yo’ newspapahs?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Take them along.”</p>

<p>And Griswold, recalled from a passage in his lecture
that dealt with contraband munitions of war, handed
over the newspapers, and saw them pass into the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
of his fellow-passenger. He had read the newspapers
pretty thoroughly, and knew the distribution of their
contents, so that he noted with surprise the girl’s immediate
absorption in the telegrams from New Orleans
relating to the difficulty between the two governors.</p>

<p>As she read she lost, he thought, something of her
splendid colour, and at one point in her reading her face
went white for a moment, and Griswold saw the paper
wrinkle under the tightening grasp of her hands. The
tidings from New Orleans had undoubtedly aroused her
indignation, which expressed itself further in the rigid
lines of her figure as she read, and in the gradual lifting
of her head, as though with some new resolution. She
seemed to lose account of her surroundings, and several
times Griswold was quite sure that he heard her half
exclaim, “Preposterous! Infamous!”</p>

<p>When she had finished the New Orleans telegrams
she cast the offending newspapers from her; then, recalling
herself, summoned the black woman, and returned
them to Griswold, the dusky agent expressing the elaborate
thanks of her race for his courtesy. The girl had
utterly ignored Griswold, and she now pulled down the
curtain at her elbow with a snap and turned her face
away from him.</p>

<p>Professor Griswold’s eyes wandered repeatedly from
his manuscript to the car ceiling, then furtively to the
uncompromisingly averted shoulder and head of the
young lady, then back to his lecture notes, until he was
weary of the process. He wished Ardmore were at hand,
for his friend would find here a case that promised much
better than the pursuit to which he had addressed himself.
The girl in this instance was at least a self-respecting
lady, not given to flirtations with chance travellers,
and the brown eyes, of which Griswold had caught one
or two fleeting glimpses, were clearly not of the winking
sort. The attendance of the black mammy distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the girl as a person of quality, whose travels were stamped
with an austere propriety.</p>

<p>Her silver toilet articles testified to an acquaintance
with the comforts if not the luxuries of life. The alligator-hide
suit-case thrust under the seat bore the
familiar label of a Swiss hotel where Griswold had once
spent a week, and spoke of the girl’s acquaintance with
an ampler world. When Phœbe had brought it forth,
the initials “B. O.” in small black letters suggested
Baltimore and Ohio to Griswold’s lazy speculations,
whereupon he reflected that while Baltimore was plausible,
the black servant eliminated Ohio; and as every
Virginian knows every other Virginian, he tried to identify
her with Old Dominion family names beginning with
O, but without result. He finally concluded that, while
her name might be Beatrice or Barbara, it could not
be Bessie, and he decided that very likely the suit-case
belonged to her brother Benjamin, in whom he felt no
interest whatever.</p>

<p>He went out to supper, secured the only remaining
table for two, and was giving his order when the young
lady appeared. She had donned her hat, and as she
stood a moment in the entrance, surveying the line of
tables, her distinction was undeniable. There were but
two vacant places in the car, one facing Griswold, the
other across the aisle at a larger table where three men
were engaged in animated discussion. The girl viewed
the prospect with evident disappointment as the waiter
drew out the vacant chair at Griswold’s table. She
carried herself bravely, but wore still a triste air that
touched Griswold’s sympathy. He rose, told the waiter
that he would sit at the other table, and the girl murmured
her thanks with a forlorn little smile as she took
his seat.</p>

<p>The appearance of Griswold aroused the Mississippian
to a renewal of the discussion of the New Orleans incident.
He was in excellent humour, and had carried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the car a quart bottle, which he pushed toward Griswold.</p>

<p>“As the Governor of North Carolina said to the
Governor of South Carolina——”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” and as he spoke Griswold’s eyes
fell upon the girl, and he saw annoyance written fleetingly
on her face.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of that whisky. It’s all
right,” the Mississippian protested.</p>

<p>“I’m confident of that; but some other time, thank
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” the Mississippian declared, “after you
left us a while ago we got to talking about Dangerfield
and his trouble with Osborne. There’s something back
of this rumpus. You see, if they lived in the same state
you might account for a fierce rivalry between them.
Both of ’em, for example, might have the senatorial
bee in their bonnets; but either one of ’em could make
the senate any time he pleased. I guess they’re the two
biggest men in the South right now. They’re too big to
be touchy about any small matter; that’s why I reckon
there’s something behind this little racket over there at
New Orleans. No passing remark would send men off
that way, so wild that they wouldn’t travel on the same
train together. Why, gentlemen——”</p>

<p>“Please pass the salt,” interposed Griswold.</p>

<p>The Mississippian enjoyed the sound of his own voice,
which boomed out above the noise of the train with
broad effects of dialect that these types will not be asked
to reproduce. Griswold’s eyes had again met those of
the girl opposite, and there was, he felt, a look of appeal
in them. The discussion distressed her, just as the telegrams
from New Orleans in the afternoon papers had distressed
her, and Griswold began at once to entertain his
table companions with his views on a number of national
political issues, that were as vital to Arizona or Wyoming
as to the Carolinas. He told stories to illustrate his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
points, and told them so well that his three companions
forgot the estrangement of the belligerent governors.</p>

<p>Griswold ran on in the low, musical voice that distinguishes
the cultivated Virginian in any company anywhere
in the world, and the noisy loquacity of the Mississippian
went down before him. He was so intent on
holding their attention that his dishes were taken from
him almost untouched. The others lingered until his
coffee was brought. He was so absorbed that he failed
to see the smile that occasionally passed over the girl’s
face as some fragment of one of his stories found its
way to her. He had undertaken to deflect the talk
from a channel which had, it seemed, some painful
association for her, but he had done more in unwittingly
diverting her own thoughts by his droll humour. He did
not cease until she had left the car, whereupon he followed
his trio of auditors to the smoking compartment,
and there suffered the Mississippian to hold uninterrupted
sway.</p>

<p>When he went back into the car at eleven o’clock he
found the girl and her maid still sitting in their sections,
though most of the other berths, including his
own, had been made up. The train was slowing down,
and wishing a breath of air before retiring, he went to
the rear platform of the sleeper, which was the last car
of the train. The porter had opened the door in the
vestibule to allow the brakeman to run back with his
torpedoes. The baggage car had developed a hot box,
and jumping out, Griswold saw lanterns flashing ahead
where the trainmen laboured with the sick wheel. The
porter vanished, leaving Griswold alone. The train had
stopped at the edge of a small town, whose scattered
houses lay darkly against the hills beyond. The platform
lamps of a station shone a quarter of a mile ahead.
The feverish steel yielded reluctantly to treatment, and
Griswold went forward and watched the men at work
for a few minutes, then returned to the end of the train.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
He swung himself into the vestibule and leaned upon
the guard rail, gazing down the track toward the brakeman’s
lantern. Then he grew impatient at the continued
delay and dropped down again, pacing back and
forth in the road-bed behind the becalmed train. The
night was overcast, with hints of rain in the air, and a
little way from the rear lights it was pitch dark. Griswold
felt sure that the train would not leave without the
brakeman, and he was further reassured by the lanterns
of the trainmen beside the baggage car. Suddenly, as
he reached the car and turned to retrace his steps, a
man sprang up, seemingly from nowhere, and accosted
him.</p>

<p>“I reckon y’u’re the gov’nor, ain’t y’u?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly, my man. What can I do for you?”
replied Griswold instantly.</p>

<p>“I reckoned it was y’u when y’u fust come out on
the platform. I’m app’inted to tell y’u, Gov’nor, that
if y’u have Bill Appleweight arrested in South Car’lina,
y’u’ll get something one of these days y’u won’t
like. And if y’u try to find me y’u’ll get it quicker.
Good-night, Gov’nor.”</p>

<p>“Good-night!” stammered Griswold.</p>

<p>The least irony had crept into the word governor as
the man uttered it and slipped away into the darkness.
The shadows swallowed him up; the frogs in the ditch
beside the track chanted dolorously; then the locomotive
whistled for the brakeman, whose lantern was already
bobbing toward the train.</p>

<p>As Griswold swung himself into the vestibule the girl
who had borrowed his newspapers turned away hurriedly
and walked swiftly before him to her section.
The porter, who was gathering her things together, said,
as she paused in the aisle by her seat,—</p>

<p>“Beginnin’ to get ready, Miss Osbo’n. We’re gwine
intu Columbia thirty minutes late all account dat hot
box.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Griswold passed on to the smoking compartment and
lighted a cigar. His acquaintances of the supper table
had retired, and he was glad to be alone with his thoughts
before the train reached Columbia. He dealt harshly
with himself for his stupidity in not having associated
the girl’s perturbation over the breach between the governor
of North Carolina and the governor of South
Carolina with the initials on her travelling bag; he had
been very dull, but it was clear to him now that she was
either the daughter or some other near relative of Governor
Osborne. In a few minutes she would leave the
train at Columbia, where the governor lived, and, being
a gentleman, he would continue on his way to Richmond,
and thence to the university, and the incident
would be closed. But Griswold was a lawyer, and he
had an old-fashioned Southern lawyer’s respect for the
majesty of law. On the spur of curiosity or impulse
he had received a threatening message intended for the
governor of South Carolina, who, from the manner of
the delivery of the message, had been expected on this
train. Griswold argued that the man who had spoken
to him had been waiting at the little station near which
they had stopped, in the hope of seeing the governor;
that the waiting messenger had taken advantage of the
unexpected halt of the train; and, further, that some
suggestion of the governor in his own appearance had
deceived the stranger. He felt the least bit guilty at
having deceived the man, but it was now clearly his
duty to see that the governor was advised of the threat
that had been communicated in so unusual a manner.</p>

<p>He was pondering whether he should do this in person
or by letter or telegram, when the rattle of the train
over the switch frogs in the Columbia yards brought him
to the point of decision.</p>

<p>The porter thrust his head into the compartment.</p>

<p>“Columbia, sah. Yo’ berth’s all ready, sah. Yo’
gwine t’ Richmond—yes, sah.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>His hands were filled with the young lady’s luggage.
The lettering on the suit-case seemed, in a way, to appeal
to Griswold and to fix his determination.</p>

<p>“Porter! Put my things off. I’ll wait here for the
morning train.”</p>

<small>THE ABSENCE OF GOVERNOR OSBORNE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Griswold</span> spent the night at the Saluda House, Columbia,
and rose in the morning with every intention of
seeing Governor Osborne, or some one in authority at his
office, as soon as possible, and proceeding to Richmond
without further delay. As he scanned the morning
newspaper at breakfast he read with chagrin this item,
prominently headlined:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Governor Osborne, who was expected home from the Cotton Planters’
Convention yesterday morning, has been unavoidably detained in Atlanta
by important personal business. Miss Barbara Osborne arrived
last night and proceeded at once to the governor’s mansion.</p>

<p>Several matters of considerable importance await the governor’s
return. Among these is the matter of dealing with the notorious
Bill Appleweight. It is understood that the North Carolina officials
are unwilling to arrest Appleweight, though his hiding-place in the
hills on the border near Kildare is well known. Although he runs back
and forth across the state line at pleasure, he is a North Carolinian
beyond question, and it’s about time Governor Dangerfield took note
of the fact. However, the governor of South Carolina may be relied
on to act with his usual high sense of public duty in this matter.</p>
</div>

<p>Professor Griswold was not pleased to learn that the
governor was still absent from the capital. He felt that
he deserved better luck after the trouble he had taken to
warn the governor. His conscience had got the better
of his comfort—he knew that, and he wrote a telegram
to the law firm at Richmond with which he was consultant,
asking that a meeting with certain clients arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
for to-day be deferred twenty-four hours. It
was now Tuesday; he had no further lectures at the
university until the following Monday, and after he had
taken his bearings of Columbia, where it occurred to
him he had not an acquaintance, he walked toward the
capitol with a well-formed idea of seeing the governor’s
private secretary—and, if that person appeared to be
worthy of confidence, apprising him of the governor’s
danger.</p>

<p>Standing in the many-pillared portico of the capitol,
Griswold turned to look down upon Columbia, a city
distinguished to the most casual eye by streets an acre
wide! And having an historical imagination and a reverence
for the past, Griswold gave himself for a moment
to Memory, hearing the tramp of armed hosts, and the
thunder of cannon, and seeing flames leap again in the
wake of battle. It was a glorious day, and the green of
late May lay like a soft scarf upon the city. The sky
held the wistful blue of spring. Griswold bared his
head to the faint breeze, or perhaps unconsciously he
saluted the bronze figure of Hampton, who rides for ever
there at the head of his stubborn legion. He turned into
the capitol with a little sigh, for he was a son of Virginia,
and here, in this unfamiliar scene, the Past was
revivified, and he felt the spell of things that were
already old when he was born.</p>

<p>It was not yet nine o’clock when he entered the
governor’s office. He waited in the reception-room,
adjoining the official chamber, but the several desks of
the clerical staff remained unoccupied. He chafed a bit
as time passed and no one appeared, for his north-bound
train left at eleven, and he could not fairly be asked to
waste the entire day here. He was pacing the floor,
expecting one of the clerks to appear at any moment,
when a man entered hurriedly, walked to the closed
inner door, shook it impatiently, and kicked it angrily
as he turned away. He was a short, thick-set man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
thirty-five, dressed in blue serge, and his movements
were quick and nervous. He growled under his breath
and swung round upon Griswold as though to tax him
with responsibility for the closed door.</p>

<p>“Has no one been here this morning?” he demanded,
glaring at the closed desks.</p>

<p>“If you don’t count me I should answer no,” replied
Griswold quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>The two gentlemen regarded each other for a moment,
contemptuous dislike clearly written on the smaller
man’s face, Griswold half-smiling and indifferent.</p>

<p>“I am waiting for the governor,” remarked Griswold,
thinking to gain information.</p>

<p>“Then you’re likely to wait some time,” jerked the
other. “The whole place seems to be abandoned. I
never saw such a lot of people.”</p>

<p>“Not having seen them myself, I must reserve judgment,”
Griswold remarked, and the blue serge suit flung
out of the room.</p>

<p>Presently another figure darkened the entrance, and
the coloured servant whom Griswold had seen attending
Miss Osborne on the train from Atlanta swept into the
reception-room, and grandly ignoring his presence, sat
down in a chair nearest the closed door of the inner
chamber. Griswold felt that this was encouraging, as
implying some link between the governor and his domestic
household, and he was about to ask the coloured
woman if she knew the business hours of the office when
the closed door opened and Miss Osborne appeared on
the threshold. The coloured woman rose, and Griswold,
who happened to be facing the door when it swung open
with such startling suddenness, stared an instant and
bowed profoundly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but I wish very much to see
Governor Osborne or his secretary.”</p>

<p>Miss Osborne, in white, trailing a white parasol in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
hand, and with white roses in her belt, still stood half
withdrawn inside the private office.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry that Governor Osborne and his
secretary are both absent,” she answered, and the two
eyed each other gravely. Griswold felt that the brown
eyes into which he looked had lately known tears;
but she held her head high, with a certain defiance,
even.</p>

<p>“That is unfortunate. I stopped here last night on
purpose to see him, and now I fear that I must leave”—and
he smiled the Griswold smile, which was one of the
secrets of his popularity at the university—“I must
leave Columbia in a very few minutes.”</p>

<p>“The office does not keep very early hours,” remarked
the girl, “but some one will certainly be here in a moment.
I am sorry you have had to wait.”</p>

<p>She had not changed her position, and Griswold rather
hoped she would not, for the door framed her perfectly,
and the sunlight from the inner windows emphasized
the whiteness of the snowy gown she wore. Her straw
hat was shaped like a soldier’s campaign hat, with sides
pinned up, the top dented, and a single feather thrust
into the side.</p>

<p>“It was not I,” said Griswold, “who so rudely shook
the door. I beg that you will acquit me of that violence.”</p>

<p>The girl did not, however, respond to his smile. She
poked the floor with her parasol a moment, then raised
her head and asked,—</p>

<p>“Who was it, if you please?”</p>

<p>“A gentleman with a brown beard, a red necktie, and
a bad disposition.”</p>

<p>“I thought as much,” she said, half to herself, and
her eyes were bent again upon the point of her parasol,
with which she was tracing a design in the rug. She
lifted her head with the abruptness of quick decision,
and looked straight at Griswold. The negress had withdrawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
to the outer door, by which she sat with sphinx-like
immovability.</p>

<p>“I am Miss Osborne. Governor Osborne is my father.
Would you mind telling me whether your business with
my father is——”</p>

<p>She hesitated, and her eyes met Griswold’s.</p>

<p>“Miss Osborne, as I have no acquaintances here, let
me introduce myself. My name is Griswold. My home
is Charlottesville. Pardon me, but you and I were
fellow-passengers from Atlanta yesterday evening. I am
unacquainted with your father, and I have no business
with him except——”</p>

<p>He was not yet clear in his mind whether to tell her
that her father’s life was threatened; it did not seem
fair to alarm her when he was powerless to help; but
as he weighed the question the girl came out into the
reception-room and sat down near the window.</p>

<p>“Won’t you have a seat, Mr. Griswold? May I ask
you again whether you know the gentleman who came
in here and beat the door a while ago?”</p>

<p>“I never saw him before in my life.”</p>

<p>“That is very well. And now, Mr. Griswold, I am
going to ask you to tell me, if you will, just what it is
you wish to say to my father.”</p>

<p>She was very earnest, and the request she made rang
the least bit imperiously. She now held the white parasol
across her lap in the tight clasp of her white-gloved
hands.</p>

<p>“I should not hesitate——” began Griswold, still uncertain
what to do.</p>

<p>“You need not hesitate in the fear that you may
alarm me. I think I know”—and she half-smiled now—“I
think perhaps I know what it is.”</p>

<p>“My reason for wishing to see your father is, then, to
warn him that if a criminal named Appleweight is
brought back from his hiding-place on the North Carolina
frontier, and tried for his crimes in South Carolina,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
the governor of that state, your father, will be made to
suffer by Appleweight’s friends.”</p>

<p>“That is what I thought,” said the girl, slowly nodding
her head.</p>

<p>“And now, to be quite honest about it, Miss Osborne,
I must confess that I received this warning last night
from a man who believed me to be the governor. To
tell the truth, I told him I was the governor!”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes made a fresh inventory of Griswold,
then she laughed for the first time—a light laugh of
honest mirth that would not be gainsaid. The beautiful
colour deepened in her cheeks; her eyes lighted merrily,
as though at the drollery of Griswold standing, so to
speak, <i>in loco parentis</i>.</p>

<p>“I have my own confession to make. I heard what
you said to that man. I had gone to the rear platform
to see what was the matter. The stop there in that preposterous
place seemed interminable. You must have
known that I listened.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose you heard what that man said to
me or what I said to him. I don’t know how I came to
palm myself off as the governor—I am not in the habit
of doing such things, but it was due, I think, to the
fact that I had just been saying to a friend of mine at
Atlanta——”</p>

<p>He ceased speaking, realizing that what he might
have said to Ardmore was not germane to the point at
issue. His responsibility for the life and security of
Governor Osborne of the sovereign state of South Carolina
was at an end, and he was entering upon a social
chat with Governor Osborne’s daughter. Some such
thought must have passed through her mind, too, for
she straightened herself in her chair and dropped the
point of her parasol to the floor. But she was the least
bit curious, in spite of herself. The young man before
her, who held his hat and gloves so quietly and who
spoke with so nice a deference in a voice so musical,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
was beyond question a gentleman, and he had stopped
at Columbia to render her father a service. There was
no reason why she should not hear what he had said to
his friend at Atlanta.</p>

<p>“What had you been saying, Mr. Griswold?”</p>

<p>“Oh, really nothing, after all! I’m ashamed of it
now! But he’s the most amusing person, with nothing
to do but to keep himself amused. We discuss many
daring projects, but we are never equal to them. I had
just been telling him that we were incapable of action;
that while we plan our battles the foe is already breaking
down the outer defences and beating in the gates.
You see, we are both very ridiculous at times, and we
talk that sort of idiocy to keep up our spirits. And
having berated my friend for his irresolution, I seized
the first opportunity to prove my own capacity for meeting
emergencies. The man flattered me with the assumption
that I was the governor of South Carolina, and I
weakly fell.”</p>

<p>Distress was again written in Miss Osborne’s face.
She had paid little heed to the latter half of Griswold’s
recital, though she kept her eyes fixed gravely upon him.
In a moment the gentleman in blue serge who had manifested
so much feeling over the governor’s absence strode
again into the room.</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Osborne, so you are back!”</p>

<p>He bowed over the girl’s hand with a great deal of
manner, then glanced at once toward the door of the
private office.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t your father come in yet? I have been looking
for him since eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>“My father is not home yet, Mr. Bosworth.”</p>

<p>“Not home! Do you mean to say that he won’t be
here to-day?”</p>

<p>“I hardly expect him,” replied the girl calmly. “Very
likely he will be at home to-night or in the morning.”</p>

<p>Griswold had walked away out of hearing; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
felt that the girl purposely raised her voice so that he
might hear what she said.</p>

<p>“I must know where he is; there’s an important
matter waiting—a very serious matter it may prove
for him if he isn’t here to-day to pass on it. I must
wire him at once.”</p>

<p>“Very good. You had better do so, Mr. Bosworth.
He’s at the Peach Tree Club, Atlanta.”</p>

<p>“Atlanta! Do you mean to say that he isn’t even in
this state to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Bosworth, and I advise you to telegraph
him immediately if your business is so urgent.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my business, Barbara; it’s the state’s business;
it’s your father’s business, and if he isn’t here
to attend to it by to-morrow at the latest, it will go
hard with him. He has enemies who will construe his
absence as meaning——”</p>

<p>He spoke rapidly, with rising anger, but some gesture
from the girl arrested him, and he turned frowningly
to see Griswold calmly intent upon an engraving at the
farther end of the room. The coloured woman was
dozing in her chair. Before Bosworth could resume,
the girl spoke, her voice again raised so that every
word reached Griswold.</p>

<p>“If you refer to the Appleweight case, I must tell
you, Mr. Bosworth, that I have all confidence that my
father will act whenever he sees fit.”</p>

<p>“But the people——”</p>

<p>“My father is not afraid of the people,” said the girl
quietly.</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand, Barbara, how much is at
stake here. If some action isn’t taken in that matter
within twenty-four hours your father will be branded
as a coward by every newspaper in the state. You seem
to take it pretty coolly, but it won’t be a trifling matter
for him.”</p>

<p>“I believe,” replied the girl, rising, “that you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
said all that I care to hear from you now or at any
further time, Mr. Bosworth, about this or any other
matter.”</p>

<p>“But, Barbara——”</p>

<p>Miss Osborne turned her back and walked to the window.
Bosworth stared a moment, then rushed angrily
from the room. Griswold abandoned his study of the
picture, and gravely inclined his head as Bosworth
passed. Then he waited a minute. The girl still stood
at the window, and there was, Griswold felt, something
a little forlorn in her figure. It was quite time that he
was off if he caught his train for Richmond. He crossed
the room, and as he approached the window Miss Osborne
turned quickly.</p>

<p>“It was kind of you to wait. That man is the state’s
attorney-general. You doubtless heard what he said to
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Osborne, I could not help hearing. I did
not leave, because I wished to say——”</p>

<p>The associate professor of admiralty in the department
of law of the University of Virginia hesitated and
was lost. Miss Osborne’s eyes were brown, with that
hint of bronze, in certain lights, that is the distinctive
possession of the blessed. Health and spirit spoke in
her bright colour. She was tall and straight, and there
was something militant in her figure as she faced Griswold.</p>

<p>“I beg to say, Miss Osborne, that if there is any way
in which I can serve you, my time is wholly at your
disposal.”</p>

<p>“I thank you. I fear that you have already given
yourself too much trouble in stopping here. My father
will wish to thank you on his return.”</p>

<p>Her lips trembled, and tears were bright in her eyes.
Then she regained control of herself.</p>

<p>“Mr. Griswold, I have no claim whatever on your
kindness, but I am in very great distress. I don’t see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
just where I can turn for aid to any one I know. But
you as a stranger may be able to help me—if it isn’t
asking too much—but then I know it is asking too
much!”</p>

<p>“Anything, anything whatever,” urged Griswold
kindly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bosworth, the attorney-general, warns me that
if my father does not use the power of the state to
capture this outlaw Appleweight, the results will be
disastrous. He says my father must act immediately.
He demanded his address, and, and—I gave it to
him.”</p>

<p>“But you must remember, Miss Osborne, that the
attorney-general probably knows the intricacies of this
case. He must have every reason for upholding your
father; in fact, it’s his sworn duty to advise him in
such matters as this.”</p>

<p>“There’s another side to that, Mr. Griswold,” and the
girl’s colour deepened; but she smiled and went on. It
was quite evident that she was animated now by some
purpose, and that she was resolved to avail herself of
Griswold’s proffered aid. “I have my own reasons for
doubting Mr. Bosworth’s motives; and I resent his
assumption that my father is not doing his full duty.
No one can speak to me of my father in that way—no
one!”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, Miss Osborne!”</p>

<p>“This whole matter must be kept as quiet as possible.
I can appeal to no one here without the risk of newspaper
publicity which would do my father very great
injury. But if it is not altogether too great a favour,
Mr. Griswold, may I ask that you remain here until
to-night—until my father returns? His secretary has
been ill and is away from town. The other clerks I sent
away on purpose this morning. Father had left his
office keys at home, and I came in to see if I could find
the papers in the Appleweight case. They are there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and on the top of the packet is a requisition on the
governor of North Carolina for Appleweight’s return.”</p>

<p>“Signed?”</p>

<p>“Signed. I’m sure he had only deferred acting in
the case until his return, and he should have been back
to-day.”</p>

<p>“But of course he will be back; it is inconceivable
that he should ignore, much less evade, a duty as plain
as this—the governor of a state—it is preposterous!
His business in Atlanta accounts for his absence. Governor
Osborne undoubtedly knows what he is about.”</p>

<p>“My father is not in Atlanta, Mr. Griswold. He is
not at the Peach Tree Club, and has not been. I have
not the slightest idea where my father is!”</p>

<p>The echoing whistle of the departing Virginia express
reached them faintly as they stood facing each other
before the open window in the governor’s reception-room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />


<small>THE JUG AND MR. ARDMORE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Thomas Ardmore</span>, of New York and Ardsley,
having seen his friend Griswold depart, sought a book-shop
where, as in many other book-shops throughout the
United States, he kept a standing order for any works
touching piracy, a subject which, as already hinted,
had long afforded him infinite diversion. He had several
hours to wait for his train to New Orleans, and he
was delighted to find that the bookseller, whom he had
known only by correspondence, had just procured for
him, through the dispersion of a Georgia planter’s valuable
library, that exceedingly rare narrative, <i>The Golden
Galleons of the Caribbean</i>, by Dominguez y Pascual—a
beautifully bound copy of the original Madrid edition.</p>

<p>With this volume under his arm, Ardmore returned to
the hotel where he was lodged and completed his arrangements
for leaving. It should be known that Mr. Thomas
Ardmore was a person of democratic tastes and habits.
In his New York house were two servants whose sole
business it was to keep himself and his wardrobe presentable;
yet he preferred to travel unattended. He
was by nature somewhat secretive, and his adventurous
spirit rebelled at the thought of being followed about
by a hired retainer. His very wealth was, in a way, a
nuisance, for wherever he went the newspapers chronicled
his movements, with speculations as to the object
of his visit, and dark hints at large public gifts which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the city honoured by his presence at once imagined
would be bestowed upon it forthwith. The American
press constantly execrated his family, and as he was
sensitive to criticism he kept very much to himself.</p>

<p>It was a matter of deep regret to Ardmore that his
great-grandfather, whose name he bore, should have
trifled with the morals of the red men, but he philosophized
that it was not his fault, and if he had known
how to squeeze the whisky from the Ardmore millions
he would have been glad to do so. His own affairs were
managed by the Bronx Loan and Trust Company, and
Ardmore took little personal interest in any of his belongings
except his estate in North Carolina, where he
dreamed his dreams, and had, on the whole, a pretty
good time.</p>

<p>When he had finished packing his trunk he went down
to the dinner he had ordered to be in readiness at a
certain hour, at a certain table, carefully chosen beforehand;
for Ardmore was very exacting in such matters,
and had an eye to the comforts of life, as he understood
them.</p>

<p>As he crossed the hotel lobby on his way to the restaurant
he was accosted by a reporter for the Atlanta
<i>Palladium</i>, who began to question him touching various
Ardmores who were just then filling rather more than
their usual amount of space in the newspapers. Ardmore’s
family, with the single exception of his sister,
Mrs. Atchison, bored him immensely. His two brothers
and another sister, the Duchess of Ballywinkle, kept the
family name in display type a great deal of the time,
and their performances had practically driven Thomas
Ardmore from New York. He felt keenly his shame in
being brother-in-law to a dissolute duke, and the threatened
marriage of one of his brothers to a chorus girl
had added, he felt, all too great a burden to a family
tree whose roots, he could not forget it, were soaked in
contraband rum. The reporter was a well-mannered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
youth, and Ardmore shook his hand encouragingly. He
was rather curious to see what new incident in the
family history was to be the subject of inquisition, and
the reporter immediately set his mind at rest.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Mr. Ardmore, but is it true that your
sister, the Duchess of Ballywinkle, has separated from
the duke?”</p>

<p>“You may quote me as saying that while I am not
quite sure, yet I sincerely hope the reports are true.
To be frank with you, I do not like the duke; in fact,
strictly between ourselves, I disliked him from the
first,” and Ardmore shook his head gravely, and meditatively
jingled the little gold pieces that he always
carried in his trousers pockets.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, I had heard that there was some
trouble between you and your brother-in-law, but can’t
the <i>Palladium</i> have your own exact statement, Mr. Ardmore,
of what caused the breach between you?”</p>

<p>Ardmore hesitated and turned his head cautiously.</p>

<p>“You understand, of course, that this discussion is
painful to me, extremely painful. And yet, so much has
been published about my sister’s domestic affairs——”</p>

<p>“Exactly, Mr. Ardmore. What we want is to print
<i>your</i> side of the story.”</p>

<p>“Very decent of you, I’m sure. But the fact is”—and
Ardmore glanced over his shoulder again to be sure
he was not overheard—“the fact is——” and he paused,
batting his eyes as though hesitating at the point of an
important disclosure.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Ardmore,” encouraged the reporter.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind telling <i>you</i>, but don’t print this.
Let it be just between ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, if you say not——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; I have every confidence in your
discretion; but if this will go no further, I don’t mind
telling you——”</p>

<p>“You may rely on me absolutely, Mr. Ardmore.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Then, with the distinct understanding that this is
<i>sub rosa</i>—now we <i>do</i> understand each other, don’t we?”
pleaded Ardmore.</p>

<p>“Perfectly, Mr. Ardmore,” and the perspiration began
to bead the reporter’s forehead in his excitement over
the impending revelation.</p>

<p>“Then you shall know why I feel so bitter about the
duke. I assure you that nothing but the deepest chagrin
over the matter causes me to tell you what I have never
revealed before—not even to members of my family—not
to my most intimate friend.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate all that——”</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is—but please never mention it—the
fact is that his Grace owes me four dollars. I gave it
to him in two bills—I remember the incident perfectly—two
crisp new bills I had just got at the bank. His
Grace borrowed the money to pay a cabman—it was the
very day before he married my sister. Now let me ask
you this: Can an American citizen allow a duke to owe
him four dollars? The villain never referred to the
matter again, and from that day to this I have made
it a rule never to lend money to a duke.”</p>

<p>The reporter stared a moment, then laughed. He
abandoned the idea of getting material for a sensational
article and scented the possibilities of a character sketch
of the whimsical young millionaire.</p>

<p>“How about that story that your brother, Samuel
Ardmore, is going to marry the chorus girl he ran over
in his automobile?”</p>

<p>“I hope it’s true; I devoutly do. I’m very fond of
music myself, and, strange to say, nobody in our family
is musical. I think a chorus girl would be a real addition
to our family. It would bring up the family dignity—you
can see that.”</p>

<p>“The wires brought a story this afternoon that your
cousin, Wingate Siddall—he is your cousin, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so. What’s Siddy’s latest?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“Why, it’s reported that he’s going to cross the Atlantic
in a balloon. Can you tell us anything about that
from the inside?”</p>

<p>“Well, the ocean is only four miles deep; I’d take
more interest in Cousin Siddy’s ballooning if you
could make it a couple of miles more to the dead
men’s chests. And now, much as I’d like to prolong
this conversation, I’ve got to eat or I’ll miss my
train.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind saying where you are going, Mr.
Ardmore?”</p>

<p>“I’d tell you in a minute, only I haven’t fully decided
yet; but I shall probably take the Sambo Flyer at 9.13,
if you don’t make me lose it.”</p>

<p>“You have large interests in Arkansas, I believe, Mr.
Ardmore?”</p>

<p>“Yes; important interests. I’m searching for the
original fiddle of the Arkansaw Traveller. When I find
it I’m going to give it to the British Museum. And now
you really must excuse me.”</p>

<p>Ardmore looked the reporter over carefully as they
shook hands. He was an attractive young fellow, alert
and good-humoured, and Ardmore liked him, as, in his
shy way, he really liked almost every one who seemed
to be a human being.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do with you. If you’ll forget
this rot we’ve been talking and come up to Ardsley as
soon as I get home, I’ll see if I can’t keep you amused
for a couple of weeks. I don’t offer that as a bribe;
my family affairs are of interest to nobody but hostlers
and kitchen-maids. Wire me at Ardsley when you’re
ready, throw away your lead-pencil, then come on and
I’ll show you the finest collection of books on Captain
Kidd in the known world. What did you say your name
is? Collins—Frank Collins? I never forget anything,
so don’t disappoint me.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty nice of you, but I don’t have much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
time for vacations,” replied the reporter, who was, however,
clearly pleased.</p>

<p>“If the office won’t give you a couple of weeks, wire
me, and I’ll buy the paper.”</p>

<p>The young man laughed outright. “I’ll remember; I
really believe you mean for me to come.”</p>

<p>“Of course I do. It’s all settled; make it next week.
Good-bye!”</p>

<p>Ardmore ate his dinner oblivious of the fact that
people at the neighbouring tables turned to look at
him. He overheard his name mentioned, and a woman
just behind him let it be known to her companions and
any one else who cared to hear that he was the brother-in-law
of the Duke of Ballywinkle. Another voice in
the neighbourhood kindly remarked that Ardmore was
the only decent member of the family, and that he
was not the one whose wife had just left him, nor yet
the one who was going to marry the chorus girl whose
father kept a delicatessen shop in Hoboken. It is very
sad to be unable to dine without having family skeletons
joggle one’s elbow, and Ardmore was annoyed. The
head waiter hung officiously near; the man who served
him was distressingly eager; and then the voice behind
him rose insistently:</p>

<p>“—worth millions and yet he can’t find anybody to
eat with him.”</p>

<p>This was almost true, and a shadow passed across
Ardmore’s face and his eyes grew grave as he humbly
reflected that he was indeed a pitiable object. He waved
away his plate and called for coffee, and at that moment
a middle-aged man appeared at the door, scanned the
room for a moment, and then threaded his way among
the tables to Ardmore.</p>

<p>“I heard you were here and thought I’d look you up.
How are you, Ardy?”</p>

<p>“Very well, thank you, Mr. Billings. Have you dined?
Sorry; which way are you heading?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>The newcomer had the bearing of a gentleman used
to consideration. He was, indeed, the secretary of the
Bronx Loan and Trust Company, whose business was
chiefly the administration of the Ardmore estate, and
Ardmore knew him very well. He was afraid that
Billings had traced him to Atlanta for one of those
business discussions which always vexed and perplexed
him so grievously, and the thought of this further depressed
his spirits. But the secretary at once eased his
mind.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for a man, and I’m not good at the business.
I’ve lost him and I don’t understand it, I don’t
understand it,” and the secretary seemed to be half-musing
to himself as he sat down and rested his arms
on the table.</p>

<p>“You might give me the job. I’m following a slight
clue myself just at present.”</p>

<p>The secretary, who had no great opinion of Ardmore’s
mental capacity, stared at the young man vacantly.
Then it occurred to him that possibly Ardmore might
be of service.</p>

<p>“Have you been at Ardsley recently?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Left there only a few days ago.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen your governor lately, have you?”</p>

<p>“My governor?” Ardmore stared blankly. “Why,
Mr. Billings, don’t you remember that father’s dead?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean your father, Ardy,” replied Billings,
with the exaggerated care of one who deals with extreme
stupidity. “I mean the Governor of North Carolina—one
of the American states. Ardsley is still in
North Carolina, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course. But bless your soul, I don’t know
the governor. Why should one?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why, Ardy; but people sometimes do
know governors and find it useful.”</p>

<p>“I’m not in politics any more, Mr. Billings. What’s
this person’s name?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Dangerfield. Don’t you ever read the newspapers?”
demanded the secretary, striving to control his inner
rage. He was in trouble, and Ardmore’s opaqueness
taxed his patience. And yet Tommy Ardmore had
given him less trouble than any other member of the
Ardmore family. The others galloped gaily through
their incomes; Tommy was rapidly augmenting his
inheritance from sheer neglect or inability to scatter
his dividends.</p>

<p>“No; I quit reading newspapers after the noble
Duke of Ballywinkle didn’t break the bank at Monte
Carlo that last time. I often wish, Mr. Billings, that
the Mohawks had scalped my great-grandfather before
they bought his whisky. That would have saved me
the personal humiliation of being brother-in-law to a
duke.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be so thin-skinned. You pay the
penalty of belonging to one of the wealthiest families
in America,” and Billings’s tone was paternal.</p>

<p>“So I’ve heard, but I’m not so terribly proud of it.
What about this governor?”</p>

<p>“That’s what troubles me—what of the governor?”
Billings dropped his voice so that no one but Ardmore
could hear. “He’s missing—disappeared.”</p>

<p>“That’s the first interesting thing I ever heard of a
governor doing,” said Ardmore. “Tell me more.”</p>

<p>“He’s had a row with the Governor of South Carolina,
at New Orleans. I was to have met him here on an
important matter of business this afternoon, but he’s
cleared out and nobody knows what’s become of him.
His daughter even, who was in New Orleans with him,
doesn’t know where he is.”</p>

<p>“When was she in New Orleans with him?” asked
Ardmore, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>“She—who?” asked Billings, annoyed.</p>

<p>“Why, the daughter!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about the daughter, but if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
could find her father I’d give him a piece of my mind,”
and the secretary’s face flushed angrily.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose she isn’t the one I’m looking for,
anyhow,” said Ardmore resignedly.</p>

<p>“I should hope not,” blurted Billings, who had not
really taken in what Ardmore said, but who assumed
that it must necessarily be something idiotic.</p>

<p>“She had fluffy hair,” persisted Ardmore to this serious-minded
gentleman whose life was devoted to the multiplication
of the Ardmore millions. Ardmore’s tone was
that of a child who persists in babbling inanities to a
distracted parent.</p>

<p>“Better let girls alone, Tommy. Mrs. Atchison told
me you were going to marry Daisy Waters, and I should
heartily approve the match.”</p>

<p>“Did Nellie tell you that? I wonder if she’s told
Daisy yet? You’ll have to excuse me now, for I’m
taking the Sambo Flyer. I’d like to find your governor
for you; and if you’ll tell me when he was seen last——”</p>

<p>“Right here, just before noon to-day, and a couple of
hours before I reached town. His daughter either doesn’t
know where he went or she won’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Ah! the daughter! She remains behind to guard
his retreat.”</p>

<p>“The daughter is still here. She’s a peppery little
piece,” and Billings looked guardedly around the room.
“That’s she, alone over there in the corner—the girl
with the white feather in her hat who’s just signing her
check. There—she’s getting up!”</p>

<p>Ardmore gazed across the room intently, then suddenly
a slight smile played about his lips. To gain the door
the girl must pass by his table, and he scrutinized her
closely as she drew near and passed. She was a little
girl, and her light fluffy hair swept out from under a
small blue hat in a shell-like curve, and the short skirt
of her tailor-made gown robbed her, it seemed, of years
to which the calendar might entitle her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“She gave me the steadiest eye I ever looked into
when I asked her where her father had gone,” remarked
Billings grimly as the girl passed. “She said she thought
he’d gone fishing for whales.”</p>

<p>“So she’s Miss Dangerfield, is she?” asked Ardmore
indifferently; and he rose, leaving on the plate, by a
sudden impulse of good feeling towards the world,
exactly double the generous tip he had intended giving.
Billings was glad to be rid of Ardmore, and they parted
in the hotel lobby without waste of words. The secretary
of the Bronx Loan and Trust Company announced
his intention of remaining another day in Atlanta in
the hope of finding Governor Dangerfield, and he was
so absorbed in his own affairs that he did not heed,
if indeed he heard, Ardmore’s promise to keep an eye
out for the lost governor. Like most other people, the
secretary of the Bronx Loan and Trust Company did
not understand Ardmore, but Thomas Ardmore, having
long ago found himself ill-judged by the careless world,
lived by standards of his own, and these would have
meant nothing whatever to Billings.</p>

<p>Ardmore’s effects had been brought down, and were
already piled on a carriage at the door. In his pocket
were his passage to New Orleans and a stateroom ticket.
At the cashier’s desk Miss Dangerfield paid her bill, just
ahead of him.</p>

<p>“If any telegrams come for my father, please forward
them to Raleigh,” said the girl. The manager came out
personally to show her to her carriage, and having shut
the door upon her, he wished Ardmore, who stood discreetly
by, a safe journey.</p>

<p>“Off for New Orleans, are you, Mr. Ardmore?” asked
the manager courteously.</p>

<p>“No,” said Ardmore, “I’m going to Raleigh to look
at the tall buildings,” whereat the manager returned to
his duties, gravely shaking his head.</p>

<p>At the station Ardmore caught sight of Miss Dangerfield,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
attended by two porters, hurrying toward the Tar
Heel Express. He bought a ticket to Raleigh, and
secured the last available berth from the conductor on
the platform at the moment of departure.</p>

<p>Ardmore did not like to be hurried, and this sudden
change of plans had been almost too much for him, but
he was consoled by the reflection that after all these
years of waiting for just such an adventure he had
proved himself equal to an emergency that required
quick thought and swift action. He had not only found
the girl with the playful eye, but he had learned her
identity without, as it were, turning over his hand. Not
even Griswold, who was the greatest man he knew—Griswold
with his acute legal mind and ability to carry
through contests of wit with lawyers of highest repute—not
even Griswold, Ardmore flattered himself, could
have managed better.</p>

<p>The stateroom door stood open, and from his seat at
the farther end of the car Ardmore caught a fleeting
glimpse of Miss Dangerfield as she threw off her jacket
and hat; then she summoned the porter, gave him her
tickets, bade him a smiling good-night, and the door
closed upon her. The broad grin on the porter’s face—a
grin of delight, as though he had spoken with some
exalted deity—filled Ardmore with bitterest envy.</p>

<p>He went back to smoke and plan his future movements.
For the first time in his life he faced to-morrow
with eager anticipations, resolved that nothing should
thwart his high resolves, though these, to be sure, were
somewhat hazy. Then, from a feeling of great satisfaction,
his spirit reacted, and he regretted that he had been
deprived of the joy of prolonged search. If he could
only have followed her until, at the last moment, when
about to give up for ever and accept the frugal consolations
of memory, he met her somewhere face to face!
These reflections led him to wonder whether he might
not have been mistaken about the wink after all. Griswold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
with his wider knowledge of the world, had scouted
the idea. Very likely if one of those blue eyes had
actually winked at him it had been out of mere playfulness,
and he would never in the world refer to it when
they met. Billings had applied the term peppery to her,
and he felt that he should always hate Billings for this;
Billings was only a financial automaton anyhow, who
bought at the lowest and sold at the highest, and bored
one very often with strangely-worded papers which one
was never expected to understand. He did not know
why Billings was so anxious to find Miss Dangerfield’s
father, but as between a man of Billings’s purely commercial
instincts and the governor of a great state like North
Carolina, Ardmore resolved to stand by the Dangerfields
to the end of the chapter. He was proud to remember
his estate at Ardsley, which was in Governor Dangerfield’s
jurisdiction, and had been visited by the game
warden, the state forester, and various other members
of the governor’s official household, though Ardmore
could not remember their names. He had never in his
life visited Raleigh, but far down some dim vista of
memory he saw Sir Walter covering a mud-puddle with
his cloak for Queen Elizabeth. It was a picture of this
moving incident in an old history that rose before him,
as he tried vainly to recall just how it was that Sir
Walter had lost his head. He wondered whether Miss
Dangerfield’s name was Elizabeth, though he hoped not,
as the name suggested a town in New Jersey where
his motor had once broken down on a rainy evening
when he was carrying Griswold to Princeton to deliver
a lecture.</p>

<p>Ardmore smoked many pipes, and did not turn in
until after midnight. The car was hot and stuffy,
and he slept badly. At some hour of the morning, being
again awake and restless, he fished his dressing-gown
and slippers out of his bag and went out on the rear
platform. His was the last car, and he found a camp-stool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and crouched down upon it in a corner of the vestibule
and stared out into the dark. The hum and click
of the rails soothed him, and he yielded himself to pleasant
reveries. Griswold was well on his way back to
Virginia, he remembered—“Dear old Grissy!” he murmured;
but he resolved to tell Griswold nothing of the
prosperous course of his quest. Griswold would never,
he knew, countenance so grave a performance as the
following of a strange girl to her home; but this would
be something for later justification.</p>

<p>Ardmore was half-dozing when the train stopped so
abruptly that he was pitched from the camp-stool into
a corner of the entry. He got himself together and
leaned out into the cool moist air.</p>

<p>The porter came out and stared, for a gentleman in
a blue silk wrapper who sat up all night in a vestibule
was new to his experience.</p>

<p>“What place is this, porter?”</p>

<p>“Kildare, sah. This place is wha’ we go from South
C’lina into No’th C’lina. Ain’t yo’ be’th comfor’ble,
sah?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, thank you.”</p>

<p>Kildare was a familiar name, and the station, that
lay at the outskirts of the town, and a long grim barracks-like
building that he identified as a cotton mill,
recalled the fact that he was not far from his own ample
acres which lay off somewhere to westward. He had
occasionally taken this route from the north in going to
Ardsley, riding or driving from Kildare about ten miles
to his house. In this way he was enabled to go or
come without appearing at all in the little village of
Ardsley.</p>

<p>The porter left him. He felt ready for sleep now,
and resolved to go back to bed as soon as the train
started. Just then a dark shadow appeared in the track,
and a man’s voice asked cautiously,—</p>

<p>“Air y’u the conductor?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>The questioner saw that he was not, before Ardmore
could reply, and hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“The porter’s in the car; you can get aboard up forward,”
Ardmore suggested.</p>

<p>“Be Gov’nor Dangerfield on this train?” asked the
man, whom Ardmore now saw dimly outlined in the
track below.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my friend. The governor’s asleep, but
I’m his private secretary. What can I do for
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, hyeh’s somethin’ fer ’im—it’s confidential.
Sure, air ye, th’ gov’nor’s in they?”</p>

<p>The man—a tall, bearded countryman in a slouch hat,
handed up to Ardmore a jug—a plain, brown, old-fashioned
American gallon jug.</p>

<p>“It’s a present fer Gov’nor Dangerfield. He’ll understand,”
and the man vanished as mysteriously as he had
appeared, leaving Ardmore holding the jug by its handle,
and feeling a little dazed by the transaction.</p>

<p>The train lingered, and Ardmore was speculating as
to which one of the Carolina commonwealths was beneath him,
when another figure appeared below in the
track—that of a bareheaded, tousled boy this time.
He stared up at Ardmore sleepily, having apparently
been roused on the arrival of the train.</p>

<p>“Air y’u the gov’nor?” he piped.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lad; in what way can I serve you?” and
Ardmore put down his jug and leaned over the guard
rail. It was just as easy to be the governor as the governor’s
private secretary, and his vanity was touched
by the readiness with which the boy accepted him in
his new <i>rôle</i>. His costume, vaguely discernible in the
vestibule light, evidently struck the lad as being some
amazing robe of state affected by governors. The
youngster was lifting something, and he now held up
to Ardmore a jug, as like the other as one pea resembles
another.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Pa ain’t home, and ma says hyeh’s yer jug o’ buttermilk.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my lad. While I regret missing your
worthy father, yet I beg to present my compliments to
your kind and thoughtful mother.”</p>

<p>He had transferred his money to his dressing-gown
pocket on leaving his berth, and he now tossed a silver
dollar to the boy, who caught it with a yell of delight
and scampered off into the night.</p>

<p>Ardmore had dropped the jugs carelessly into the
vestibule, and he was surveying them critically when
the train started. The wheels were beginning to grind
reluctantly when a cry down the track arrested his attention.
A man was flying after the train, shouting at the
top of his lungs. He ran, caught hold of the rail, and
howled,—</p>

<p>“The gov’nor ain’t on they! Gimme back my jug.”</p>

<p>“Indian-giver!” yelled Ardmore. He stooped down,
picked up the first jug that came to hand, and dropped
it into the man’s outstretched arms.</p>

<p>The porter, having heard voices, rushed out upon
Ardmore, who held the remaining jug to the light, scrutinizing
it carefully.</p>

<p>“Please put this away for me, porter. It’s a little gift
from an old army friend.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Ardmore returned to his berth, fully pleased
with his adventures, and slept until the porter gave
warning of Raleigh.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />


<small>DUTY AND THE JUG.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Thomas Ardmore</span>, one trunk, two bags, and a little
brown jug reached the Guilford House, Raleigh, at eight
o’clock in the morning. Ardmore had never felt better
in his life, he assured himself, as he chose a room with
care, and intimated to the landlord his intention of
remaining a week. But for the ill luck of having his
baggage marked he should have registered himself
falsely on the books of the inn; but feeling that this
was not quite respectable, he assured the landlord, in
response to the usual question, that he was not Ardmore
of New York and Ardsley, but an entirely different
person.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t blame you for not wanting to be taken
for any of that set,” remarked the landlord sympathetically.</p>

<p>“I should think not!” returned Ardmore, in a tone
of deep disgust.</p>

<p>The Guilford House coffee was not just what he was
used to, but he was in an amiable humour, and enjoyed
hugely the conversation of the commercial travellers
with whom he took his breakfast. He did not often
escape from himself or the burden of his family reputation,
and these strangers were profoundly entertaining.
It had never occurred to Ardmore that man could
be so amiable so early in the day, and his own spirits
rallied as he passed the sugar, abused the hot bread, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
nodded his approval of bitter flings at the inns of other
southern towns of whose existence he only vaguely knew.
They spoke of the president of the United States and
of various old world monarchs in a familiar tone that
was decidedly novel and refreshing; and he felt that it
was a great privilege to sit at meat with these blithe
spirits. Commercial travellers, he now realized, were
more like the strolling players, the wandering knights,
the cloaked riders approaching lonely inns at night, than
any other beings he had met out of books. It was with
the severest self-denial that he resisted an impulse to
invite them all to visit him at Ardsley or to use his
house in Fifth Avenue whenever they pleased. When
the man nearest him, who was having a second plate of
corn-cakes and syrup, casually inquired his “line,” Ardmore
experienced a moment of real shame, but remembering
the jug he had acquired in the night, he replied,—</p>

<p>“Crockery.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s drugs. Do you know Billy Gallop?—he’s in
your line.”</p>

<p>“Should say I did,” replied Ardmore unhesitatingly.
“I took supper with him in Philadelphia Sunday night.”</p>

<p>“How’s trade?”</p>

<p>“Bully,” replied Ardmore, reaching for the syrup. “I
broke my record yesterday.”</p>

<p>The drug man turned to listen to a discussion of the
row between Governors Osborne and Dangerfield precipitated
by one of the company who had fortified himself
with a newspaper, and Ardmore also gave ear.</p>

<p>“Whatever did happen at New Orleans,” declared a
Maiden Lane jewellery representative, “you can be quite
sure that Dangerfield won’t get the hot end of the poker.
I’ve seen him, right here at Raleigh, and he has all the
marks of a fighting man. He’d strip at two hundred,
and he’s six in his socks.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Those big fellows are all meat and no
muscle,” retorted the drug man. “I doubt if there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
any fight in him. Now Osborne’s a different product—a
tall, lean cuss, but active as a cat. A man to be governor
of South Carolina has got to have the real stuff
in him. If it comes to a show-down you’ll see Dangerfield
duck and run.”</p>

<p>This discussion was continued at length, greatly to
Ardmore’s delight, for he felt that in this way he was
being brought at once into touch with Miss Dangerfield,
now domiciled somewhere in this town, and to whom he
expected to be properly introduced just as soon as he
could devise some means to that end. As he had not
read the newspapers, he did not know what the row was
all about, but he instinctively aligned himself on the
Dangerfield side. The Osbornes were, he felt, an inferior
race, and he inwardly resented the imputations
upon Governor Dangerfield’s courage.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the governor’s back yet?” asked one man.</p>

<p>“The morning paper says not, but he’s expected to-day,”
replied the man with the newspaper.</p>

<p>“About the first thing he’ll have to do will be to face
the question of arresting Appleweight. I was in Columbia
the other day, and everybody was talking of the
case. They say”—and the speaker waited for the fullest
attention of his hearers—“they say Osborne ain’t none
too anxious to have Appleweight arrested on his side of
the line.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Ardmore.</p>

<p>“Well, you hear all kinds of things. It was only
whispered down there, but they say Osborne was a little
too thick with the Appleweight crowd before he was
elected governor. He was their attorney, and they were
a bad lot for any man to be attorney for. But they
haven’t caught Appleweight yet.”</p>

<p>“Where’s he hiding? don’t the authorities know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s up there in the hills on the state line. His
home is as much on one side as the other. He spends a
good deal of time in Kildare.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Kildare?” asked Ardmore, startled at the word.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the county seat, what there is of it. I hope
you never make that town?” and the inquirer bent a
commiserating glance upon Ardmore.</p>

<p>“Well, they use jugs there, I know that!” declared
Ardmore; whereat the table roared. The unanimity of
their applause warmed his heart, though he did not
know why they laughed.</p>

<p>“You handle crockery?” asked a man from the end
of the table. “Well, I guess Dilwell County consumes a
few gross of jugs all right. But you’d better be careful
not to whisper jugs too loud here. There’s usually a
couple of revenue men around town.”</p>

<p>They all went together to the office, where they picked
up their sample cases and sallied forth for a descent
upon the Raleigh merchants; and Ardmore, thus reminded
that he was in the crockery business, and that
he had a sample in his room, sat down under a tree on
the sidewalk at the inn door to consider what he should
do with his little brown jug. It had undoubtedly been
intended for Governor Dangerfield, who was supposed
to be on the train he had himself taken from Atlanta to
Raleigh. There had been, in fact, two jugs, but one of
them he had tossed back into the hands of the man who
had pursued the train at Kildare. Ardmore smoked his
pipe and meditated, trying to determine which jug he
had tossed back; and after long deliberation, he slapped
his knee, and said aloud,—</p>

<p>“I gave him the wrong one, by jing!”</p>

<p>The boy had said that his offering contained buttermilk,
a beverage which Ardmore knew was affected by
eccentric people for their stomach’s sake. He had sniffed
the other jug, and it contained, undeniably, an alcoholic
liquid of some sort.</p>

<p>Jugs had not figured prominently in Ardmore’s domestic
experiences; but as he sat under the tree on the
curb before the Guilford House he wondered, as many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
other philosophers have wondered, why a jug is so incapable
of innocency! A bottle, while suggestive, is not
inherently wicked; but a jug is the symbol of joyous
sin. Even the soberest souls, who frown at the mention
of a bottle, smile tolerantly when a jug is suggested.
Jugs of many centuries are assembled in museums, and
round them the ethnologist reconstructs extinct races
of men; and yet even science and history, strive they
never so sadly, cannot wholly relieve the jug of its
cheery <i>insouciance</i>. A bottle of inferior liquor may be
dressed forth enticingly, and alluringly named; but
there’s no disguising the jug; its genial shame cannot
be hidden. There are pleasant places in America where,
if one deposit a half-dollar and a little brown jug behind
a certain stone, or on the shady side of a blackberry
bush, jug and coin will together disappear between
sunset and sunrise; but lo! the jug, filled and plugged
with a corn-cob, will return alone mysteriously, in contravention
of the statutes in such cases made and provided.
Too rare for glass this fluid, which bubbles out
of the southern hills with as little guilt in its soul as the
brooks beside which it comes into being! But, lest he
be accused of aiding and abetting crime against the
majesty of the law, this chronicler hastens to say that
on a hot day in the harvest field, honest water, hidden
away in a little brown jug in the fence corner, acquires
a quality and imparts a delight that no mug of crystal
or of gold can yield.</p>

<p>As Mr. Ardmore pondered duty and the jug a tall
man in shabby corduroy halted near by and inspected
him carefully. Mr. Ardmore, hard upon his pipe, had
not noticed him, somewhat, it seemed, to the stranger’s
vexation. He patrolled the sidewalk before the inn,
hoping to attract Ardmore’s attention, but finding that
the young man’s absorption continued, he presently
dropped into a neighbouring chair under the maple tree.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” said Ardmore pleasantly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>The man nodded but did not speak. He was examining
Ardmore with a pair of small, shrewd gray eyes. In
his hands he held a crumpled bit of brown paper that
looked like a telegram.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you jest got to town this mornin’,
young fella.”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” Ardmore replied promptly. He had
never been addressed in quite this fashion before, but
it was all in keeping with his new destiny, and he was
immediately interested in the stranger, who was well
on in middle age, with a rough grizzled beard, and a
soft hat, once black, that now struggled for a compromise
tint between yellow and green.</p>

<p>“Ever been hyeh befo’?”</p>

<p>“Never; but I’m crazy about the place, and I’ll be
seen here a good deal hereafter.”</p>

<p>Ardmore produced his cigar-case and extended it to
the stranger. The man, awed by the splendour of the
case, accepted a cigar a little gingerly.</p>

<p>“Drummer, I reckon?”</p>

<p>“Commercial traveller, we prefer to be designated,”
replied Ardmore, with dignity.</p>

<p>“I guess drummer’s good enough down hyeh. What
y’u carry?”</p>

<p>“Jugs. I’m in the jug business. Never had any business
but jugs.”</p>

<p>The man paused in lighting his cigar, stared at Ardmore
over the flaming match, drew the fire into the cigar
several times, then settled back with his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p>“Full ’r empty?”</p>

<p>“The jugs? Oh, empty jugs; but it’s no affair of mine
what becomes of the jugs afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Y’u likely got samples with y’u?”</p>

<p>“Well, not many. You see my line is so well known
I don’t have to carry samples any more. The trade
knows our goods.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Stop at Kildare on the way up?” and the stranger
looked about guardedly.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my friend, I always ‘make’ Kildare,”
replied Ardmore, using a phrase he had acquired at
breakfast.</p>

<p>“Train runs through the’ pretty late at night?”</p>

<p>“Beastly. But I hardly ever sleep, anyhow. A man
in my splendid health doesn’t need sleep. It’s a rotten
waste of time.”</p>

<p>Silence for several minutes; then the stranger leaned
forward in his chair, resting his elbows on his knees,
and said in a low tone,—</p>

<p>“I got a telegram hyeh says y’u got a jug thet y’u
ain’t no right t’ last night at Kildare. I want thet jug,
young fella.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s very unfortunate. Ordinarily I should be
delighted, but I really couldn’t give away my Kildare
jug. Now if it was one of my other jugs—even my
Omaha jug or my dear old Louisville jug—I shouldn’t
hesitate a minute, but that old Kildare jug! My dear
man, you don’t know what you ask!”</p>

<p>“Y’ll give me thet jug, or it’ll be the worse for y’u.
Y’u ain’t in thet game, young fella.”</p>

<p>“Not in it! You don’t know whom you are addressing.
I’m not only in the game, but I’m in to the finish,”
declared Ardmore, sitting upright in his chair. “You’ve
got the wrong idea, my friend, if you think you can intimidate
me. That jug was given me by a friend, a very
old and dear friend——”</p>

<p>“A friend of yourn!”</p>

<p>The keen little gray eyes were blinking rapidly.</p>

<p>“One of the best friends I ever had in this world,”
and Ardmore’s face showed feeling. “He and I charged
side by side through the bloodiest battles of our Civil
War. I will cheerfully give you my watch, or money
in any sum, but the jug—I will part with my life first!
And now,” concluded Ardmore, “while I should be glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
to continue this conversation, my duties call me elsewhere.”</p>

<p>As he rose, the man stood quickly at his side, menacingly.</p>

<p>“Give me thet jug, or I’ll shoot y’u right hyeh in the
street.”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t do that, Old Corduroy. I can see
that you are kind and good, and you wouldn’t shoot down
an unarmed man. Besides, it would muss up the street.”</p>

<p>“Y’u took thet jug from my brother by lyin’ to ’im.
He’s telegraphed me to git it, and I’m a-goin’ to do it.”</p>

<p>“Your brother sent you? It was nice of him to ask
you to call on me. Why, I’ve known your brother intimately
for years.”</p>

<p>“Knowed my brother?” and for the first time the
man really seemed to doubt himself. “Wheh did y’u
know Bill?”</p>

<p>“We roomed together at Harvard, that’s how I know
him, if you force me to it! We’re both Hasty Pudding
men. Now if you try to bulldoze me further, I’ll slap
your wrists. So there!”</p>

<p>Ardmore entered the hotel deliberately, climbed to his
room, and locked the door. Then he seized the little
brown jug, drew the stopper, and poured out a tumblerful
of clear white fluid. He took a swallow, and shuddered
as the fiery liquid seemed instantly to cause every
part of his being to tingle. He wiped the tears from
his eyes and sat down. The corn-cob stopper had fallen
to the floor, and he picked it up and examined it carefully.
It had been fitted tightly into the mouth of the
jug by the addition of a bit of calico, and he fingered
it for a moment with a grin on his face. He was, considering
his tranquil past, making history rapidly, and
he wished that Griswold, whom he imagined safely away
on his law business at Richmond, could see him now
embarked upon a serious adventure, that had already
brought him into collision with a seemingly sane man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
who had threatened him with death. Griswold had been
quite right about their woeful incapacity for rising to
emergencies, but the episode of the jugs at Kildare was
exactly the sort of thing they had discussed time and
time again, and it promised well. His throat was raw,
as though burned with acid, and it occurred to him for
an anxious moment that perhaps he had imbibed a
poison intended for the governor.</p>

<p>He was about to replace the cob stopper when, to his
astonishment, it broke in his fingers, and out fell a carefully
folded slip of paper. He carried it to the window
and opened it, finding that it was an ordinary telegraph
blank on which were written in clear round characters
these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Appleweight crowd never done you harm. If you have any
of them arrested you will be shot down on your own doorstep.</p>
</div>

<p>When Mr. Thomas Ardmore had read this message
half a dozen times with increasing satisfaction he folded
it carefully and put it away in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>Taking half a sheet of notepaper he wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Appleweight and his gang are cowards. Within ten days those
that have not been hanged will be in jail at Kildare.</p>
</div>

<p>He studied the phraseology critically, and then placed
the paper in the cob stopper, whose halves he tied together
with a bit of twine. As the jug stood on the table
it was, to all appearances, exactly as it had been when
delivered to Ardmore on the rear of the train at Kildare,
and he was thoroughly well pleased with himself. He
changed the blue scarf with which he had begun the day
for one of purple with gold bars, and walked up the
street toward the state house.</p>

<p>This venerable edifice, meekly reposing amid noble
trees, struck agreeably upon Ardmore’s fancy. Here
was government enthroned in quiet dignity, as becomes
a venerable commonwealth, wearing its years like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
veteran who has known war and tumult, but finds at
last tranquillity and peace. He experienced a feeling of
awe, without quite knowing it, as he strolled up the
walk, climbed the steps to the portico and turned to look
back from the shadow of the pillars. He had never but
once before visited an American public building—the
New York city hall—and he felt that now, indeed, he
had turned a corner and entered upon a new and strange
world. He had watched army manœuvres abroad with
about the same attention that he gave to a ballet, and
with a like feeling of beholding a show contrived for
the amusement of spectators; but there was not even
a policeman here to represent arsenals and bayonets. The
only minion of government in sight was the languid
operator of a lawn-mower, which rattled and hummed
cheerily in the shadow of the soldiers’ monument. There
was something fine about a people who, as he learned
from the custodian, would not shake down these historic
walls obedient to the demands of prosperity and
growth, but sent increased business to find lodgment
elsewhere. He ascended to the toy-like legislative chambers,
where flags of nation and state hung side by side,
and where the very seats and desks of the law-makers
spoke of other times and manners.</p>

<p>Mr. Ardmore, feeling that he should now be about his
business, sought the governor’s office, where a secretary,
who seemed harassed by the cares of his position, confirmed
Ardmore’s knowledge of the governor’s absence.</p>

<p>“I didn’t wish to see the governor on business,”
explained Ardmore pleasantly, leaning upon his stick
with an air of leisure. “He and my father were old
friends, and I always promised my father that I would
never pass through Raleigh without calling on Governor
Dangerfield.”</p>

<p>“That is too bad,” remarked the young man sympathetically,
though with a preoccupation that was eloquent
of larger affairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Could you tell me whether any members of the
governor’s family are at home?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; Mrs. Dangerfield and Miss Jerry are at
the mansion.”</p>

<p>“Miss Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Miss Geraldine. We all call her Miss Jerry in North
Carolina.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; to be sure. Let me see; it’s over this way
to the mansion, isn’t it?” inquired Ardmore.</p>

<p>“No; out the other end of the building—and turn to
your right. You can’t miss it.”</p>

<p>The room was quiet, the secretary a young man of
address and intelligence. Here, without question, was
the place for Ardmore to discharge his business and be
quit of it; but having at last snatched a commission
from fleeting opportunity, it was not for him to throw
it to another man. As he opened the door to leave, the
secretary arrested him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr.—pardon me, but did you come in from the
south this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I came up on the Tar Heel Express from
Atlanta.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. Of course you didn’t sit up all night?
There’s some trouble brewing around Kildare. I thought
you might have heard something, but, of course, you
couldn’t have been awake at two o’clock in the morning?”</p>

<p>The secretary was so anxious to acquit him of any
knowledge of the situation at Kildare that it seemed
kindest to tell him nothing. The secretary’s face lost
its anxiety for a moment, and he smiled.</p>

<p>“The governor has an old friend and admirer up there
who always puts a jug of fresh buttermilk on board
when he passes through. The governor was expected
home this morning, and I thought maybe——”</p>

<p>“You’re positive it’s always buttermilk, are you?”
asked Ardmore, with a grin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Certainly,” replied the secretary, with dignity.
“Governor Dangerfield’s sentiments as to the liquor
traffic are well known.”</p>

<p>“Of course, all the world knows that. But I’m afraid
all jugs look alike to me; but then, the fact is I’m in
the jug business myself. Good-morning.”</p>

<p>The governor’s mansion was easily found, and having
walked about the neighbourhood until his watch marked
eleven, Ardmore entered the grounds and rang the bell
at the front door.</p>

<p>Once within, the air of domestic peace, the pictures
on the walls, a whip and a felt hat with a blue band on
the hall table, and a book on a chair in the drawing-room,
turned down to mark the absent reader’s place,
rebuked him for his impudence. If he had known just
how to escape he would have done so; but the maid
who admitted him had said that Miss Dangerfield was
at home, and had gone in search of her with Ardmore’s
card. He deserved to be sent to jail for entering a
gentleman’s house in this way. He realized now, when
it was too late, that he ought to have brought letters
to one of the banks and been introduced to the Dangerfields
by some gentleman of standing, if he wished to
know them. The very portraits on the walls, the photographs
on the mantel and table, frowned coldly upon
him. The foundations of his character were set in
sand; he knew that, because he had found it so easy
to lie, and he had been told in his youth that one sin
paved the way for another. He would take the earliest
train for Ardsley and bury himself there for the remainder
of his days. He had hardly formed this resolution
when a light step sounded in the hall, and Miss
Geraldine Dangerfield stood at the threshold. His good
resolutions went down like a house of cards.</p>

<p>“Miss Dangerfield,” he began, “I had the pleasure of
meeting your father in New Orleans the other day, and
as I was passing through town unexpectedly, I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
I should give myself the pleasure of calling on him.
He said that in case I found him absent I might call
upon you. In fact, he wrote a line on a card for me
to present, but I stupidly left it at my hotel.”</p>

<p>They faced each other in the dim, cool room for what
seemed to him endless centuries. She was much younger
than he had imagined; but her eyes were blue, just
as he remembered them, and her abundant light hair
curled away from her forehead in pretty waves, and was
tied to-day with a large bow of blue ribbon. For an
instant she seemed puzzled or mystified, but her blue
eyes regarded him steadily. The very helplessness of
her youth, the simplicity of her blue linen gown, the
girlish ribbon in her hair, proclaimed him blackguard.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please sit down, Mr. Ardmore?”</p>

<p>And when they were seated there was another pause,
during which the blue eyes continued to take account of
him, and he fingered his tie, feeling sure that there was
something wrong with it.</p>

<p>“It’s warm, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is. It’s a way summer has, of being
mostly warm.”</p>

<p>He was quite sure that she was laughing at him;
there was a tinge of irony in the very way in which she
pronounced “wa’m,” lingeringly, as though to prolong
her contempt for his stupidity in not finding anything
better to say.</p>

<p>She had taken the largest chair in the room, and it
seemed to hide her away in its shadows, so that she could
examine him at her leisure as he sat under a window
in the full glare of its light.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed meeting your father so much, Miss Dangerfield.
I think we are always likely to be afraid of great
men, but your father made me feel at home at once.
And he tells such capital stories—I’ve been laughing
over them ever since I left New Orleans.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Father has quite a reputation for his stories. When
did you leave New Orleans, Mr. Ardmore?”</p>

<p>“Sunday night. I stopped in Atlanta a few hours
and came on through. What a fine old town Atlanta
is! don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do not, Mr. Ardmore. It’s so dreadfully
northernized.”</p>

<p>When she said “no’thenized” her intonation gave the
word a fine, cutting edge.</p>

<p>“I suppose, Mr. Ardmore, that you saw papa at the
luncheon at the Pharos Club in New Orleans?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Miss Dangerfield. It was there I met the
governor!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was there, Mr. Ardmore?”</p>

<p>“Why, I think that was the place. I don’t know my
New Orleans as I should, but——”</p>

<p>Ardmore was suddenly conscious that Miss Dangerfield
had risen, and that she stood before him, with her
fair face the least bit flushed, her blue eyes alight with
anger, and that the hands at her sides were clenched
nervously.</p>

<p>“My father was not at luncheon at the Pharos Club,
Mr. Ardmore. You never saw my father in your life.
I know why it is you came here, and if you are not out
of that door in one second I shall call the servants and
have them throw you out.”</p>

<p>She ceased abruptly and turned to look into the hall
where steps sounded.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma; I’ll be up in just a minute. Please
don’t wait for me. It’s only the man to see about the
plumbing.”</p>

<p>The lady who had appeared for an instant at the door
went on slowly up the stairs, and the girl held Ardmore
silent with her steady eyes until the step died away
above.</p>

<p>“I know what you want my father for. Mr. Billings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and you are both pursuing him—it’s infamous, outrageous!
And it isn’t his fault. I would have you
know that my father is an honourable man!”</p>

<p>The bayonets were at his breast: he would ask for
mercy.</p>

<p>“Miss Dangerfield, you are quite mistaken about me.
I shall leave Raleigh at once, but I don’t want you to
think I came here on any errand to injure or annoy
your father.”</p>

<p>“You are one of <i>those</i> Ardmores, and Mr. Billings
represents you. You thought you could come here and
trick me into telling where my father is. But I’m not
so easily caught. My mother is ill because of all this
trouble, and I must go to her. But first I want to see
that you leave this house!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry you are in trouble. On my honour,
Miss Dangerfield, I know nothing of Billings and his
business with your father.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you will deny that you saw Mr. Billings
in Atlanta yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. I can’t exactly——”</p>

<p>“You’d better not! I saw you there talking to him;
and I suppose he sent you here to see what you could
find out.”</p>

<p>The room whirled a moment as she dealt this staggering
blow. Billings, of the Bronx Loan and Trust Company,
had said that Miss Dangerfield was peppery, but
his employment of this trifling term only illustrated his
weak command of the English language. It is not pleasant
to be pilloried for undreamed-of crimes, and Ardmore’s
ears tingled. He must plunge deeper and trust
to the gods of chance to save him. He brought himself
together with an effort, and spoke so earnestly that the
words rang oddly in his own ears.</p>

<p>“Miss Dangerfield, you may call me anything you
please, but I am not quite the scoundrel you think me.
It’s true that I was not in New Orleans, and I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
saw your father in my life. I came to Raleigh on a
mission that has absolutely nothing to do with Mr.
Billings; he did not know I was coming. On the way
here a message intended for your father came into my
hands. It was thrown on the train at Kildare last
night. I had gone out on the platform because the
sleeper was hot, and a warning to your father to keep
his hands off of Appleweight was given to me. Here it
is. It seems to me that there is immediate danger in
this, and I want to help you. I want to do anything
I can for you. I didn’t come here to pry into your
family secrets, Miss Dangerfield, honestly I didn’t!”</p>

<p>She took the piece of paper into her slim little hands
and read it, slowly nodding her head, as if the words
only confirmed some earlier knowledge of the threat
they contained. Then she lifted her head, and her eyes
were bright with mirth as Ardmore’s wondering gaze
met them.</p>

<p>“Did <i>you</i> get the jug?”</p>

<p>“I got two jugs, to tell the truth; but when they
seemed dissatisfied and howled for me to give one back,
I threw off the buttermilk.”</p>

<p>“You threw back father’s buttermilk to the man
who gave you the applejack? Oh! oh!”</p>

<p>Miss Jerry Dangerfield sat down and laughed; and
Ardmore, glad of an opportunity to escape, found his
hat and rushed from the house.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />


<small>MR. ARDMORE OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">She</span> never did it; she never, never did!”</p>

<p>Mr. Ardmore, from a bench in the State House Park,
thus concluded a long reverie. It was late afternoon,
and he had forgotten luncheon in his absorption. There
was no manner of use in recurring again to that episode
of the lonely siding. He had found the girl—indubitably
the girl—but not the wink! Miss Jerry Dangerfield
was not the winking sort; he was well satisfied on that
point, and so thoroughly ashamed into the bargain that
he resolved to lead a different life and be very heedful
of the cry of the poor in the future. His emotions had
never been taxed as to-day, and he hoped that he might
never again suffer the torture he had experienced as he
waited in the governor’s drawing-room for Miss Dangerfield
to appear. After that agony it had been a positive
relief to be ordered out of the house. Her anger when
she caught him lying about having met her father in
New Orleans was superior to any simulated rage he had
ever seen on the stage, and no girl with a winking eye
would be capable of it. He was not clever; he knew
that; but if he had had the brains of a monkey he
would not have risked his foolish wits against those of
a girl like Geraldine Dangerfield, who had led him into
an ambush and then shot him to pieces.</p>

<p>“She threatened to have the servants throw me out!”
he groaned. And her slight, tense figure rose before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
him, and her voice, still the voice of young girlhood,
rang in his ears. As she read the threatening message
from Kildare he had noted the fineness of her hands,
the curve of her fair cheek, the wayward curls on her
forehead, and he remembered all these things now, but
more than anything else her wrath, the tiny fists, the
flashing eyes as she confronted him. As he sat dejectedly
on his park bench he was unaware that Miss
Geraldine Dangerfield, walking hurriedly through the
park on her way from the governor’s mansion to the
state house, passed directly behind him. His attitude
was so eloquent of despair that it could not have failed
to move a much harder heart than that of Miss Dangerfield,
yet she made no sign; but a few minutes later the
private secretary came out on the steps of the state
house, and after a brief survey of the landscape crossed
the lawn and called Ardmore by name.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but Miss Dangerfield wished me
to say that she’d like to see you for a minute. She’s at
the governor’s office.”</p>

<p>A prisoner, sentenced to death, and unexpectedly
reprieved with the rope already on his neck, could not
experience greater relief than that which brought Mr.
Thomas Ardmore to his feet.</p>

<p>“You are sure of it—that there’s no mistake?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Miss Dangerfield told me I was to
bring you back.”</p>

<p>Enthroned at the secretary’s desk, a mass of papers
before her, Miss Geraldine Dangerfield awaited him. He
was ready to place his head on the block in sheer contrition
for his conduct, but she herself took the initiative,
and her tone was wholly amiable.</p>

<p>“This morning, Mr. Ardmore——”</p>

<p>“Oh, please forget this morning!” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“But I was rude to you; I threatened to have you
thrown out of the house; and you had come to do us
a favour.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Miss Dangerfield, I cannot lie to you. You are one
of the most difficult persons to lie to that I have ever
met. I didn’t come to Raleigh just to warn your father
that his life was threatened. I can’t lie to you about
that——”</p>

<p>“Then you <i>are</i> a spy?” and Miss Dangerfield started
forward in her chair so suddenly that Ardmore dropped
his hat.</p>

<p>“No! I am not a spy! I don’t care anything about
your father. I never heard of him until yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like that!” ejaculated Miss Dangerfield.</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean that I wasn’t interested in him—why
should I be? I don’t know anything about
politics.”</p>

<p>“Neither does father. That’s why he’s governor. If
he were a politician he’d be a senator. But”—and she
folded her hands and eyed him searchingly—“here’s a
lot of telegrams from the sheriff of Dilwell County about
that jug. How on earth did you come to get it?”</p>

<p>“Lied, of course. I allowed them to think I was intimately
associated in business with the governor, and
they began passing me jugs. Then the man who gave
the jug with that message in the cork got suspicious,
and I dropped the buttermilk jug back to him.”</p>

<p>“You traded buttermilk for moonshine?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t exactly call it moonshine. It’s more like
dynamite than anything else. I’ve written a reply to
the note and put it back in the cork, and I’m going to
return it to Kildare.”</p>

<p>“What answer did you make to that infamous effort
to intimidate my father?” demanded Miss Dangerfield.</p>

<p>“I told the Appleweight gang that they are a lot of
cowards, and that the governor will have them all in
jail or hanged within ten days.”</p>

<p>“Splendid! Perfectly <i>splendid</i>! Did you really say
that?”</p>

<p>“What else could I do? I knew that that’s what the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
governor would say—he’d have to say it—so I thought
I’d save him the trouble.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the jug now, Mr. Ardmore?”</p>

<p>“In my room at the hotel. The gang must have
somebody on guard here. A gentleman who seemed
to be one of them called on me this morning, demanding
the jug; and if he’s the man I think he is, he’s stolen
the little brown jug from my room in the hotel by this
time.”</p>

<p>Miss Dangerfield had picked up a spool of red tape,
and was unwinding it slowly in her fingers and rewinding
it. They were such nice little hands, and so peaceful
in their aimless trifling with the tape that he was sure
his eyes had betrayed him into imagining she had
clenched them in the quiet drawing-room at the mansion.
This office, now that its atmosphere enveloped him,
was almost as domestic as the house in which she lived.
The secretary had vanished, and a Sabbath quiet was
on the place. The white inner shutters swung open,
affording a charming prospect of the trees, the lawn,
and the monument in the park outside. And pleasantest
of all, and most soothing to his weary senses, she
was tolerating him now; she had even expressed approval
of something he had done, and he had never hoped for
this. She had not even pressed him to disclose his real
purpose in visiting Raleigh, and he prayed that she
would not return to this subject, for he had utterly lost
the conceit of his own lying gift. Miss Dangerfield
threw down the spool of tape and bent toward him
gravely.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore, can you keep a secret?”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever tried me with one, but I think I can,
Miss Dangerfield,” he murmured humbly.</p>

<p>“Then please stand up.”</p>

<p>And Ardmore rose, a little sheepishly, like a school-boy
who fears blame and praise alike. Miss Dangerfield
lifted one of the adorable hands solemnly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“I, acting governor of North Carolina, hereby appoint
you my private secretary, and may God have mercy on
your soul. You may now sit down, Mr. Secretary.”</p>

<p>“But I thought there was a secretary already. And
besides, I don’t write a very good hand,” Ardmore stammered.</p>

<p>“I am just sending Mr. Bassford to Atlanta to find
papa. He’s already gone, or will be pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“But I thought your father would be home to-night.”</p>

<p>Miss Dangerfield looked out of the open window upon
the park, then into the silent outer hall, to be sure she
was not overheard.</p>

<p>“Papa will not be at home to-night, or probably to-morrow
night, or the night afterward. I’m not sure
we’ll wait next Christmas dinner for papa.”</p>

<p>“But, of course, you know where he is! It isn’t possible——”
and Ardmore stared in astonishment into
Miss Dangerfield’s tranquil blue eyes.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> possible. Papa is ducking his official responsibilities.
That’s what’s the matter with papa! And I
guess they’re enough to drive any man into the woods.
Just look at all this!”</p>

<p>Miss Dangerfield rested one of those diminutive hands
of hers on the pile of documents, letters, and telegrams
the secretary had left behind him; with a nod of the
head she indicated the governor’s desk in the inner
room, and it too was piled high with documents.</p>

<p>“I supposed,” faltered Ardmore, “that in the absence
of the governor the lieutenant-governor would act. I
think I read that once.”</p>

<p>“You must have read it wrong, Mr. Ardmore. In
North Carolina, in the absence of the governor, I am
governor! Don’t look so shocked; when I say I, I
mean I—<i>me!</i> Do you understand what I said?”</p>

<p>“I heard what you said, Miss Dangerfield.”</p>

<p>“I mean what I said, Mr. Ardmore. I have taken you
into my confidence because I don’t know you. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
know anything about you. I don’t want to know anything
about you. I’d be ashamed to ask anybody I
know to help me. The people of North Carolina must
never know that the governor is absent during times of
great public peril. And if <i>you</i> are afraid, Mr. Ardmore,
you had better not accept the position.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing I wouldn’t do for you,” blurted
Ardmore.</p>

<p>“I’m not asking you—I <i>would</i> not ask you—to do
anything for me. I am asking you to do it for the
Old North State. Our relations, Mr. Ardmore, will not
be social, but purely official. Do you accept the terms?”</p>

<p>“I do; and I warn you now that I shall never resign.”</p>

<p>“I have heard papa say that life is short and the
tenure of office uncertain. I can remove you at any
time I please. Now do you understand that this is a
serious business? There’s likely to be a lot of trouble,
and no time for asking questions, so when I say it’s so
it’s so.”</p>

<p>“It’s so,” repeated Ardmore docilely.</p>

<p>“Now, here’s the sheriff at Kildare, on our side of the
line, who writes to say that he is powerless to catch
Appleweight. He’s afraid of the dark, that man! You
see, the grand jury in Dilwell County—that’s Kildare,
you know—has indicted Appleweight as a common outlaw,
but the grand jurors were all friends of Appleweight,
and the indictment was only to satisfy law-and-order
sentiment and appease the Woman’s Civic League of
Raleigh. Now, papa doesn’t—I mean <i>I</i> don’t want to
offend those Appleweight people by meddling in this
business. Papa wants Governor Osborne to arrest
Appleweight in South Carolina; but I don’t believe
Governor Osborne will dare do anything about it. Now,
Mr. Ardmore, I am not going to have papa called a
coward by anybody, particularly by South Carolina
people, after what Governor Osborne said of our state.”</p>

<p>“Why, what did he say?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“He said in a speech at Charleston last winter that
no people who fry their meat can ever amount to anything,
and he meant us! I can never forgive him for
that; besides, his daughter is the stuck-upest thing!
And I’d like Barbara Osborne to tell me how <i>she</i> got
into the Colonial Dames, and what call <i>she</i> has to be
inspector-general of the Granddaughters of the Mexican
War; for I’ve heard my grandfather Dangerfield say
many a time that old Colonel Osborne and his South
Carolina regiment never did go outside of Charleston
until the war was over and the American army had come
back home.”</p>

<p>One tiny fist this time! Ardmore was sure of it.
Her indignation against the Osbornes was so sincere, the
pouting petulance to which it diminished so like a
child’s, and the gravity of the offence so novel in his
simple experiences, that Ardmore was bound in chains
before her speech was finished. The little drawl with
which she concluded gave heightened significance to her
last three words, so that it seemed that all the veterans
of the war with Mexico trudged by, bearing the flag of
North Carolina and no other banner.</p>

<p>“Governor Osborne is a contemptible ruffian,” declared
Ardmore, with deep feeling.</p>

<p>Miss Dangerfield nodded judicial approval, and settled
back in her chair the better to contemplate her new
secretary, and said,—</p>

<p>“I’m a Daughter of the Confederacy and a Colonial
Dame. What are you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll never speak to me again; papa
sent three expensive substitutes to the Civil War.”</p>

<p>“Three! Horrible!”</p>

<p>“Two of them deserted, and one fell into the Potomac
on his way south and was drowned. I guess they
didn’t do you folks much harm.”</p>

<p>“We’ll forgive you that; but what did your ancestors
do in the Revolution?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“I’m ashamed to say that my great-grandfather was
a poor guesser. He died during Washington’s second
administration still believing the Revolution a failure.”</p>

<p>“Do you speak of the war of 1861 as the Rebellion
or as the war between the states? I advise you to be
careful what you say,” and Miss Jerry Dangerfield was
severe.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I ever mentioned it either way, so
I’m willing to take your word for it.”</p>

<p>“The second form is correct, Mr. Ardmore. When
well-bred Southern people say Rebellion they refer to
the uprising of 1776 against the British oppressor.”</p>

<p>“Good. I’m sure I shall never get them mixed. Now
that you are the governor, what are you going to do first
about Appleweight?”</p>

<p>“I’ve written—that is to say, papa wrote before he
went away—a strong letter to Governor Osborne, complaining
that Appleweight was hiding in South Carolina
and running across the state line to rob and murder
people in North Carolina. Papa told Governor Osborne
that he must break up the Appleweight crowd, or he
would do something about it himself. It’s a splendid
letter; you would think that even a coward like Governor
Osborne would do something after getting such a
letter.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he answer the letter?”</p>

<p>“Answer it? He never got it! Papa didn’t send it;
that’s the reason! Papa’s the kindest man in the world,
and he must have been afraid of hurting Governor Osborne’s
feelings. He wrote the letter, expecting to send
it, but when he went off to New Orleans he told Mr.
Bassford to hold it till he got back. He had even signed
it—you can read it if you like.”</p>

<p>It was undoubtedly a vigorous epistle, and Ardmore
felt the thrill of its rhetorical sentences as he read. The
official letter paper on which it was typewritten, and the
signature of William Dangerfield, governor of North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Carolina, affixed in a bold hand, were sobering in themselves.
The dignity and authority of one of the sovereign
American states was represented here, and he
handed the paper back to Miss Dangerfield as tenderly
as though it had been the original draft of Magna
Charta.</p>

<p>“It’s a corker, all right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t much like the way it ends. It says, right
here”—and she bent forward and pointed to the place
under criticism—“it says, ‘Trusting to your sense of
equity, and relying upon a continuance of the traditional
friendship between your state and mine, I am,
sir, awaiting your reply, very respectfully, your obedient
servant.’ Now, I wouldn’t trust to his sense of anything,
and that traditional friendship business is just
fluffy nonsense, and I wouldn’t be anybody’s obedient
servant. I decided when I wasn’t more than fifteen
years old, with a lot of other girls in our school, that
when we got married we’d never say obey, and we
never have, though only three of our class are married
yet, but we’re all engaged.”</p>

<p>“Engaged?”</p>

<p>“Of course; we’re engaged. I’m engaged to Rutherford
Gillingwater, the adjutant-general of this state.
You couldn’t be my private secretary if I wasn’t engaged;
it wouldn’t be proper.”</p>

<p>The earth was only a flying cinder on which he strove
for a foothold. She had announced her engagement to
be married with a cool finality that took his breath
away; and not realizing the chaos into which she had
flung him, she returned demurely to the matter of the
letter.</p>

<p>“We can’t change that letter, because it’s signed close
to the ‘obedient servant,’ and there’s no room. But
I’m going to put it into the typewriter and add a postscript.”</p>

<p>She sat down before the machine and inexpertly rolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the sheet into place; then, with Ardmore helping her to
find the keys, she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I demand an imediate reply.</p>
</div>

<p>“<i>Demand</i> and <i>immediate</i> are both business words.
Are you sure there’s only one <i>m</i> in immediate? All
right, if you know. I reckon a postscript like that doesn’t
need to be signed. I’ll just put ‘W. D.’ there with papa’s
stub pen, so it will look really fierce. Now, you’re the
secretary; you copy it in the copying press and I’ll
address the envelope.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you have to put the state seal on it?” asked
Ardmore.</p>

<p>“Of course not. You have to get that from the secretary
of state, and I don’t like him; he has such funny
whiskers, and calls me little girl. Besides, you never
put the seal on a letter; it’s only necessary for official
documents.”</p>

<p>She bade him give the letter plenty of time to copy,
and talked cheerfully while he waited. She spoke of
her friends, as Southern people have a way of doing, as
though every one must of course know them—a habit
that is illuminative of that delightful Southern neighbourliness
that knits the elect of a commonwealth into a
single family, that neither time and tide nor sword and
brand can destroy. Ardmore’s humility increased as the
names of the great and good of North Carolina fell from
her lips; for they were as strange to him as an Abyssinian
dynasty. It was perfectly clear that he was not
of her world, and that his own was insignificant and
undistinguished compared with hers. His spirit was
stayed somewhat by the knowledge that he, and not
the execrable Gillingwater, had been chosen as her coadjutor
in the present crisis. His very ignorance of the
royal families of North Carolina, which she recited so
glibly, and the fact that he was unknown at the capital,
had won him official recognition, and it was for him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
now to prove his worth. The political plot into which
he had been most willingly drawn pleased him greatly;
it was superior to his fondest dream of adventure, and
now, moreover, he had what he never had before, a
definite purpose in life, which was to be equal to the
task to which this intrepid girl assigned him.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s done,” said Miss Jerry, when the letter,
still damp from the copy-press, had been carefully
sealed and stamped. “Governor Osborne will get it in
the morning. I think maybe we’d better telegraph him
that it’s coming.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see much use in that, when he’ll get the letter
first thing to-morrow,” Ardmore suggested. “It costs
money to telegraph, and you must have an economical
administration.”</p>

<p>“The good of it would be to keep him worried and
make him very angry. And if he told Barbara Osborne
about it, it would make her angry, too, and maybe she
wouldn’t sleep any all night, the haughty thing! Hand
me one of those telegraph blanks.”</p>

<p>The message, slowly thumped out on the typewriter,
and several times altered and copied, finally read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Raleigh</span>, N. C.</p>

<p>The Honourable Charles Osborne,<br />
<span class="indentleft">Governor of South Carolina,</span><br />
<span class="indentleft2">Columbia, S. C.:</span></p>

<p>Have written by to-night’s mail in Appleweight matter. Your
vacillating course not understood.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">William Dangerfield</span>, &#160; &#160; <br />
Governor of North Carolina.</p>
</div>

<p>“I reckon that will make him take notice,” and Miss
Jerry viewed her work with approval. “And now, Mr.
Ardmore, here’s a telegram from Mr. Billings which I
don’t understand. See if you know what it means.”</p>

<p>Ardmore chuckled delightedly as he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cannot understand your outrageous conduct in bond matter. If
payment is not made June first your state’s credit is ruined. Where
is Foster? Answer to Atlanta.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">George P. Billings.</span></p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“I don’t see what’s so funny about that! Mr. Bassford
was walking the floor with that message when I
came to the office. He said papa and the state were
both going to be ruined. There’s a quarter of a million
dollars to be paid on bonds that are coming due June
first, and there isn’t any money to pay them with. That’s
what he said. And Mr. Foster is the state treasurer, and
he’s gone fishing.”</p>

<p>“Fishing?”</p>

<p>“He left word he had gone fishing. Mr. Foster and
papa don’t get along together, and Mr. Bassford says
he’s run off just to let those bonds default and bring
disgrace on papa and the state.”</p>

<p>Ardmore’s grin broadened. The Appleweight case
was insignificant compared with this new business with
which he was confronted. He was vaguely conscious
that bonds have a way of coming due, and that there is
such a thing as credit in the world, and that it is something
that must not be trifled with; but these considerations
did not weigh heavily with him. For the first
time in his uneventful life vengeance unsheathed her
sword in his tranquil soul. Billings had always treated
him with contempt, as a negligible factor in the Ardmore
millions, and here at last was an opportunity to balance
accounts.</p>

<p>“I will show you how to fix Billings. Just let me
have one of those blanks.”</p>

<p>And after much labour, and with occasional suggestions
from Miss Jerry, the following message was presently
ready for the wires:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your famous imputation upon my honour and that of the state
shall meet with the treatment it deserves. I defy you to do your
worst. If you come into North Carolina or bring legal proceedings
for the collection of your bonds I will fill you so full of buckshot that
forty men will not be strong enough to carry you to your grave.</p>
</div>

<p>“Isn’t that perfectly grand!” murmured Jerry admiringly.
“But I thought your family and the Bronx Loan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
and Trust Company were the same thing. That’s what
Rutherford Gillingwater told me once.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right. Billings works for us. Before
I came of age he used to make me ask his permission
when I wanted to buy a new necktie, and when I was in
college he was always fussing over my bills, and humiliating
me when he could.”</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t make him so mad that he will cause
papa trouble and bring disgrace on our administration.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about Billings. He is used to having
people get down on their knees to him, and the
change will do him good. When he gets over his first
stroke of apoplexy he will lock himself in a dark room
and begin to think hard about what to do. He usually
does all the bluffing, and I don’t suppose anybody ever
talked to him like this telegram in all his life. Where
is this man Foster?”</p>

<p>“Just fishing; that’s what Mr. Bassford said, but he
didn’t know where. Father was going to call a special
session of the legislature to investigate him, and he was
so angry that he ran off so that papa would have to look
after those bonds himself. Then this Appleweight case
came up, and that worried papa a great deal. Here’s
his call for the special session. He told Mr. Bassford to
hold that, too, until he came back from New Orleans.”</p>

<p>Ardmore read Governor Dangerfield’s summons to the
legislature with profound interest. It was signed, but
the space for the date on which the law-makers were to
assemble had been left blank.</p>

<p>“It looks to me as though you had the whole state in
your hands, Miss Dangerfield. But I don’t believe we
ought to call the special session just yet. It would be
sure to injure the state’s credit, and it will be a lot more
fun to catch Foster. I wonder if he took all the state
money with him.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bassford said he didn’t know and couldn’t find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
out, for the clerks in the treasurer’s office wouldn’t tell
him a single thing.”</p>

<p>“One should never deal with subordinates,” remarked
Ardmore sagely. “Deal with the principals—I heard a
banker say that once, and he was a man who knew everything.
Besides, it will be more fun to attend to the
bonds ourselves.”</p>

<p>He seemed lost in reverie for several minutes, and she
asked with some impatience what he was studying about.</p>

<p>“I was trying to think of a word they use when the
government has war or any kind of trouble. It’s something
about a corpse, but I can’t remember it.”</p>

<p>“A corpse? How perfectly horrid! Can it be possible,
Mr. Ardmore, that you mean the writ of habeas
corpus?” The twinkle in his eye left her unable to
determine whether his ignorance was real, or assumed
for his own amusement.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” beamed Ardmore. “We’ve got to suspend
it if worst comes to worst. Then you can put anybody
you like into a dungeon, and nobody can get him
out—not for a million years.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where they keep it?” asked Jerry. “It
must be here somewhere. Perhaps it’s in the safe.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s a thing, like a lemon, or a photograph,
or a bottle of ink; it’s a document, like a Thanksgiving
proclamation, and you order out the militia, and
the soldiers have to leave their work and assemble at
their armouries, and it’s all very serious, and somebody
is likely to get shot.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be nice to shoot people,”
said Jerry. “That would do the administration a terrible
lot of harm.”</p>

<p>“Of course we won’t resort to extreme measures unless
we are forced to it. And then, after we have exhausted
all the means at our command, we can call on the president
to send United States troops.”</p>

<p>He was proud of his knowledge, which had lingered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
in his subconsciousness from a review of the military
power of the states which he had heard once from Griswold,
who knew about such matters; but he was brought
to earth promptly enough.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore, how dare you suggest that we call
United States troops into North Carolina! Don’t you
know that would be an insult to every loyal son of this
state? I should have you know that the state of North
Carolina is big enough to take care of herself, and if
any president of the United States sends any troops
down here while I’m running this office, he’ll find that,
while our people will gladly die, they never surrender.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean anything like that by what I said,”
pleaded Ardmore, frightened almost to tears. “Of
course, we’ve got our own troops, and we’ll get through
all our business without calling for help. I shouldn’t
any more call on the president than I’d call on the Czar
of Russia.”</p>

<p>She seemed satisfied with this disclaimer, and produced
a diary in which Governor Dangerfield had noted
his appointments far into the future.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to break a lot of engagements for papa.
Here’s a speech he promised to make at Wilmington at
the laying of the corner-stone of the new orphan asylum.
That’s to-morrow, and papa can’t be there, so we’ll send
a telegram of congratulation to be read instead. Then
he was to preside at a convention of the Old Fiddlers’
Association at Goldsboro the next day, and he can’t do
that. I guess we’d better telegraph and say how sorry
he is to be delayed by important official business. And
here’s—why, I had forgotten about the National Guard
encampment, that’s beginning now.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the state militia?” Ardmore inquired.</p>

<p>“Why, of course. They’re having their annual
encampment over in Azbell County at Camp Dangerfield—they
always name the camp for the governor—and
father was to visit the camp next Saturday for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
annual inspection. That’s near your county, where
your farm is; didn’t you know that?”</p>

<p>Ardmore was humble, as he always was when his
ignorance was exposed, but his face brightened joyfully.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t break that engagement. Those troops
ought to be inspected. Inspecting his troops is one of
the most important things a governor has to do. It’s
just like a king or an emperor. I’ve seen Emperor
William and King Humbert inspect their soldiers, and
they go galloping by like mad, with all the soldiers
saluting, and it’s perfectly bully. And then there have
to be manœuvres, to see whether the troops know how
to fight or not, and forced marches and sham battles.”</p>

<p>“Papa always speaks to the men,” suggested Jerry, a
little abashed by the breadth and splendour of Ardmore’s
knowledge. His comparison of the North Carolina militia
with the armies of Europe pleased her.</p>

<p>“I think the ladies of the royal family inspect the
troops too, sometimes,” he continued. “The queens are
always honorary colonels of regiments, and present them
with flags, which is a graceful thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Gillingwater never told me that, and he’s the
adjutant-general of the state and ought to know.”</p>

<p>“What’s he colonel of?” asked Ardmore gloomily.</p>

<p>“He was colonel in the Spanish war, or was going to
be, but he got typhoid fever, and so he couldn’t go to
Cuba, and papa appointed him adjutant-general as a
reward for his services; but everybody calls him Colonel
just the same.”</p>

<p>“It looks like a pretty easy way of getting a title,”
murmured Ardmore. “I had typhoid fever once, and
nearly died, and all my hair came out.”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to speak that way of my fiancé. It’s
quite impertinent in a mere private secretary to talk
so.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. I forgot that you were engaged.
You’ll have to go to Camp Dangerfield and inspect the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
troops yourself, and they would a lot rather have you
inspect them than have your father do it.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t say things like that! I thought I told
you your appointment carried no social recognition. You
mustn’t talk to me as though I was a girl you really
know——”</p>

<p>“But there’s no use of making-believe such things
when I do know you!”</p>

<p>“Not the least little tiny bit, you don’t! Do you
suppose, if you were a gentleman I knew and had been
introduced to, I would be talking to you here in papa’s
office?”</p>

<p>“But I pretend to be a gentleman; you certainly
wouldn’t be talking to me if you thought me anything
else.”</p>

<p>“I can’t even discuss the matter, Mr. Ardmore. A
gentleman wouldn’t lie to a lady.”</p>

<p>“But if you know I’m a liar, why are you telling me
these secrets and asking me to help you play being
governor?” and Ardmore, floundering hopelessly, marvelled
at her more and more.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly the reason—because you came poking
up to my house and told me that scandalous fib about
meeting papa in New Orleans. Mr. Bassford is a beautiful
liar; that’s why he’s papa’s secretary; but you are
a much more imaginative sort of liar than Mr. Bassford.
He can only lie to callers about papa being engaged, or
write encouraging letters to people who want appointments
which papa never expects to make; but you lie
because you can’t help it. Now, if you’re satisfied, you
can take those telegrams down to the telegraph office;
and you’d better mail that letter to Governor Osborne
yourself, for fear the man who’s running the lawn-mower
will forget to come for it.”</p>

<p>The roll of drums and the cry of a bugle broke in
upon the peace of the late afternoon. Miss Jerry rose
with an exclamation and ran out into the broad portico<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
of the state house. Several battalions of a tide-water
regiment, passing through town on their way to Camp
Dangerfield, had taken advantage of a wait in Raleigh
to disembark and show themselves at the capital. They
were already halted and at parade rest at the side of the
street, and a mounted officer in khaki, galloping madly
into view, seemed to focus the eyes of the gathering
crowd. He was a gallant figure of a man; his mount
was an animal that realized Job’s ideal of a battle-horse;
the soldiers presented arms as the horseman rode the
line. Miss Dangerfield waved her handkerchief, standing
eagerly on tiptoe to make her salutation carry as far
as possible.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked Ardmore, with sinking spirit.</p>

<p>“Why, Rutherford Gillingwater, of course.”</p>

<p>“Fours right!” rang the command a moment later,
and the militiamen tramped off to the station.</p>

<p>It was then that Ardmore, watching the crowd disperse
at the edge of the park, saw his caller of the morning
striding rapidly across the street. Ardmore started
forward, then checked himself so suddenly that Miss
Jerry Dangerfield turned to him inquiringly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Nothing. I have been robbed, as I hoped to be.
Over there, on the sidewalk, beyond the girl in the pink
sunbonnet, goes my little brown jug. That lank individual
with the shabby hat has lifted it out of my room
at the hotel, just as I thought he would.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />


<small>MR. GRISWOLD FORSAKES THE ACADEMIC LIFE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Osborne</span> had asked Griswold to await the outcome
of the day, and, finding himself thus possessed of
a vacation, he indulged his antiquarian instincts by exploring
Columbia. The late afternoon found him in the
lovely cathedral churchyard, where an aged negro, tending
the graves of an illustrious family, leaned upon his
spade and recited the achievements and virtues of the
dead. Men who had been law-makers, others who had
led valiantly to battle, and ministers of the Prince of
Peace, mingled their dust together; and across the crisp
hedges a robin sang above Timrod’s grave.</p>

<p>As the shadows lengthened, Griswold walked back to
the hotel, where he ate supper, then, calling for a horse,
he rode through the streets in a mood of more complete
alienation than he had ever experienced in a foreign
country; yet the very scents of the summer night, stealing
out from old gardens, the voices that reached him
from open doorways, spoke of home.</p>

<p>As he reached the outskirts of town and rode on
toward the governor’s mansion, his mood changed, and
he laughed softly, for he remembered Ardmore, and
Ardmore was beyond question the most amusing person
he knew. It was unfortunate, he generously reflected,
that Ardmore, rather than himself, had not been plunged
into this present undertaking, which was much more in
Ardmore’s line than his own. There would, however, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
a great satisfaction in telling Ardmore of his unexpected
visit to Columbia, in exchange for his friend’s report of
his pursuit of the winking eye. He only regretted that
in the nature of things Columbia is a modern city, a seat
of commerce as well as of government, a place where
bank clearings are seriously computed, and where the
jaunty adventurer with sword and ruffles is quite likely
to run afoul of the police. Yet his own imagination
was far more fertile than Ardmore’s, and he would have
hailed a troop of mail-clad men as joyfully as his friend
had he met them clanking in the highway. Thus
modern as we think ourselves, the least venturesome
among us dreams that some day some turn of a street
corner will bring him face to face with what we please
to call our fate; and this is the manifestation of our
last drop of mediæval blood. The grimmest seeker after
reality looks out of the corner of his eye for the flutter
of a white handkerchief from the ivied tower he affects
to ignore; and, in spite of himself, he is buoyed by the
hope that some day a horn will sound for him over the
nearest hill.</p>

<p>Miss Osborne met him at the veranda steps. Indoors
a mandolin and piano struck up the merry chords of <i>The
Eutaw Girl</i>.</p>

<p>“My young sisters have company. We’ll sit here, if
you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>She led the way to a quiet corner, and after they were
seated she was silent a moment, while the light from
the windows showed clearly that her perplexity of the
morning was not yet at an end. The music tinkled
softly, and a breeze swept in upon them with faint
odours of the garden.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t mind, Mr. Griswold, if I appear to
be ashamed of you. It’s not a bit hospitable to keep you
outside our threshold; but—you understand—I don’t
have to tell you!”</p>

<p>“I understand perfectly, Miss Osborne!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“It seems best not to let the others know just why you
are here. I told my sisters that you were an old friend—of
father’s—who wished to leave a message for him.”</p>

<p>“That will do first-rate!” he laughed. “My status is
fixed. I know your father, but as for ourselves, we are
not acquainted.”</p>

<p>He felt that she was seriously anxious and troubled,
and he wished to hearten her if he could. The soft dusk
of the faintly-lighted corner folded her in. Behind her
the vines of the verandah moved slightly in the breeze.
A thin, wayward shaft of light touched her hair, as
though searching out the gold. When we say that people
have atmosphere, we really mean that they possess indefinite
qualities that awaken new moods in us, as by
that magic through which an ignorant hand thrumming
a harp’s strings may evoke some harmony denied to conscious
skill. He heard whispered in his heart a man’s
first word of the woman he is destined to love, in which
he sets her apart—above and beyond all other womenkind;
she is different; she is not like other women!</p>

<p>“It is nearly nine,” she said, her voice thrilling
through him. “My father should have been here an
hour ago. We have heard nothing from him. The
newspapers have telephoned repeatedly to know his
whereabouts. I have put them off by intimating that
he is away on important public business, and that his
purpose might be defeated if his exact whereabouts
were known. I tried to intimate, without saying as
much, that he was busy with the Appleweight case.
One of the papers that has very bitterly antagonized
father ever since his election has threatened to expose
what the editor calls father’s relations with Appleweight.
I cannot believe that there is anything wrong about
that; of course there is not!”</p>

<p>She was controlling herself with an effort, and she
broke off her declaration of confidence in her absent
father sharply but with a sob in her voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“I have no doubt in the world that the explanation
you gave the newspapers is the truth of the matter.
Your father must be absent a great deal—it is part of
a governor’s business to keep in motion. But we may
as well face the fact that his absence just now is most
embarrassing. This Appleweight matter has reached a
crisis, and a failure to handle it properly may injure
your father’s future as a public man. If you will pardon
me, I would suggest that there must be some one whom
you can take into your confidence—some friend, some
one in your father’s administration that you can rely
on?”</p>

<p>“Yes; father has many friends; but I cannot consider
acknowledging to any one that father has disappeared
when such a matter as this Appleweight case
is an issue through the state. No; I have thought of
every one this afternoon. It would be a painful thing
for his best friends to know what is—what seems to be
the truth.” Her voice wavered a little, but she was
brave, and he was aware that she straightened herself
in her chair, and, when wayward gleams of light fell
upon her face, that her lips were set resolutely.</p>

<p>“You saw the attorney-general this morning,” she
went on. “As you suggested, he would naturally be
the one to whom I should turn, but I cannot do it. I—there
is a reason”—and she faltered a moment—“there
are reasons why I cannot appeal to Mr. Bosworth
at this time.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders as though throwing off a
disagreeable topic, and he saw that there was nothing
more to be said on this point. His heart-beats quickened
as he realized that she was appealing to him;
that, though he was only the most casual acquaintance,
she trusted him. It was a dictum of his, learned in his
study and practice of the law, that issues must be met
as they offer—not as the practitioner would prefer to
have them, but as they occur; and here was a condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
of affairs that must be met promptly if the unaccountable
absence of the governor was to be robbed of its embarrassing
significance.</p>

<p>As he pondered for a moment, a messenger rode into
the grounds, and Miss Osborne slipped away and met
the boy at the steps. She came back and opened a
telegram, reading the message at one of the windows. An
indignant exclamation escaped her, and she crumpled
the paper in her hand.</p>

<p>“The impudence of it!” she exclaimed. He had
risen, and she now turned to him with anger and scorn
deepening her beautiful colour. Her breath came
quickly; her head was lifted imperiously; her lips
quivered slightly as she spoke.</p>

<p>“This is from Governor Dangerfield. Can you imagine
a man of any character or decency sending such a message
to the governor of another state?”</p>

<p>She watched him as he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Raleigh</span>, N. C.</p>

<p>The Honourable Charles Osborne,<br />
<span class="indentleft">Governor of South Carolina,</span><br />
<span class="indentleft2">Columbia, S. C.:</span></p>

<p>Have written by to-night’s mail in Appleweight matter. Your
vacillating course not understood.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">William Dangerfield</span>, &#160; &#160; <br />
Governor of North Carolina.</p>
</div>

<p>“What do you think of that?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I think it’s impertinent, to say the least,” he replied
guardedly.</p>

<p>“Impertinent! It’s the most contemptible, outrageous
thing I ever heard of in my life! Governor
Dangerfield has dilly-dallied with that case for two years.
His administration has been marked from the beginning
by the worst kind of incompetence. Why, this man
Appleweight and his gang of outlaws only come into
South Carolina now and then to hide and steal, but they
commit most of their crimes in North Carolina, and
they always have. Talk about a vacillating course!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Father has never taken steps to arrest those men, out
of sheer regard for Governor Dangerfield; he thought
North Carolina had some pride, and that her governor
would prefer to take care of his own criminals. What
do you suppose Appleweight is indicted for in this state?
For stealing one ham—one single ham from a farmer in
Mingo County, and he’s killed half a dozen men in
North Carolina.”</p>

<p>She paced the corner of the veranda angrily, while
Griswold groped for a solution of the problem. The
telegram from Raleigh was certainly lacking in diplomatic
suavity. It was patent that if the governor of
North Carolina was not tremendously aroused, he was
playing a great game of bluff; and on either hypothesis
a prompt response must be made to his telegram.</p>

<p>“I must answer this at once. He must not think we
are so stupid in Columbia that we don’t know when
we’re insulted. We can go through the side door to
father’s study and write the message there,” and she
led the way.</p>

<p>“It might be best to wait and see what his letter is
like,” suggested Griswold, with a vague wish to prolong
this discussion, that he might enjoy the soft glow of the
student lamp on her cheek.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what his letter says; it can’t be worse
than his telegram. We’ll answer them both at once.”</p>

<p>She found a blank and wrote rapidly, without asking
suggestions, with this result:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Honourable William Dangerfield,<br />
<span class="indentleft3">Raleigh, N. C.:</span></p>

<p>Your extremely diverting telegram in Appleweight case received
and filed.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Charles Osborne</span>, &#160; &#160; <br />
Governor of South Carolina.</p>
</div>

<p>She met Griswold’s obvious disappointment with
prompt explanation.</p>

<p>“You see, the governor of South Carolina cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
stoop to an exchange of billingsgate with an underbred
person like that—a big, solemn, conceited creature in a
long frock-coat and a shoestring necktie, who boasts of
belonging to the common ‘peo-pull.’ He doesn’t have
to tell anybody that, when it’s plain as daylight. The
way to answer him is not to answer at all.”</p>

<p>“The way to answer him is to make North Carolina
put Appleweight in jail, for crimes committed in that
state, and then, if need be, we can satisfy the cry for
vengeance in South Carolina by flashing our requisition.
There is a rule in such cases that the state having the
heaviest indictments shall have precedence; and you
say that in this state it’s only a matter of a ham. I
am not acquainted with the South Carolina ham,” he
went on, smiling, “but in Virginia the right kind of a
ham is sacred property, and to steal one is a capital
offence.”</p>

<p>“I should like to steal one such as I had last winter
in Richmond,” and Miss Osborne forgot her anger; her
eyes narrowed dreamily at an agreeable memory.</p>

<p>“Was it at Judge Randolph Wilson’s?” asked Griswold
instantly.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, it was at Judge Wilson’s, Mr. Griswold.
How did you know?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know—I guessed; for I have sat at that
table myself. The judge says grace twice when there’s
to be ham—once before soup, then again before ham.”</p>

<p>“Then thanksgiving after the ham would be perfectly
proper!”</p>

<p>Miss Osborne was studying Griswold carefully, then
she laughed, and her attitude toward him, that had
been tempered by a certain official reserve, became at
once cordial.</p>

<p>“Are you the Professor Griswold who is so crazy
about pirates? I’ve heard the Wilsons speak of you,
but you don’t look like that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I look like a pirate? Thank you! I had an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
appointment at Judge Wilson’s office this morning to
talk over a case in which I’m interested.”</p>

<p>“I remember now what he said about you. He said
you really were a fine lawyer, but that you liked to read
about pirates.”</p>

<p>“That may have been what he said to you; but he
has told me that the association of piracy and law was
most unfortunate, as it would suggest unpleasant comments
to those who don’t admire the legal profession.”</p>

<p>“And you are one of those tide-water Griswolds, then,
if you know the Randolph Wilsons. They are very
strong for the tide-water families; to hear them talk
you’d think the people back in the Virginia hills weren’t
really respectable.”</p>

<p>“It’s undeniably the right view of the matter,” laughed
Griswold, “but now that I live in Charlottesville I don’t
insist on it. It wouldn’t be decent in me. And I have
lots of cousins in Lexington and through the Valley.
The broad view is that every inch of the Old Dominion
is holy ground.”</p>

<p>“It is an interesting commonwealth, Mr. Griswold;
but I do not consider it holy ground. South Carolina
has a monopoly of that;” and then the smile left her
face and she returned to the telegram. “Our immediate
business, however, is not with Virginia, or with
South Carolina, but with the miserable commonwealth
that lies between.”</p>

<p>“And that commonwealth,” said Griswold, wishing to
prolong the respite from official cares, “that state known
in law and history as North Carolina, I have heard
called, by a delightful North Carolina lady I met once
at Charlottesville, a valley of humility between two
mountains of conceit. That seems to hit both of us!”</p>

<p>“North Carolina isn’t a state at all,” Miss Osborne
declared spitefully; “it’s only a strip of land where
uninteresting people live. And now, what do you say
to this telegram?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Excellent. It’s bound to irritate, and it leaves him
in the dark as to our—I mean Governor Osborne’s—intentions.
And those intentions——”</p>

<p>During this by-play he had reached a decision as to
what should be done, and he was prepared to answer
when she asked, with an employment of the pronoun
that pleasantly emphasized their relationship,—</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> our intentions?”</p>

<p>“We are going to catch Appleweight, that’s the first
thing—and until we get him we’re going to keep our
own counsel. Let me have a telegraph blank, and I
will try my hand at being governor.” He sat down in
the governor’s chair, asked the name of the county seat
of Mingo, and wrote without erasure or hesitation this
message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>To the Sheriff of Mingo County,<br />
<span class="indentleft4">Turner Court House, S. C.:</span></p>

<p>Make every possible effort to capture Appleweight and any of his
gang who are abroad in your county. Swear in all the deputies you
need, and if friendliness of citizens to outlaws makes this impossible
wire me immediately, and I will send militia. Any delay on your
part will be visited with severest penalties. Answer immediately by
telegraph.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Charles Osborne</span>, &#160; &#160; <br />
Governor of South Carolina.</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s quite within the law,” said Griswold, handing
Barbara the message; “and we might as well put
the thing through at a gallop. I’ll get the telegraph
company to hold open the line to Turner Court House
until the sheriff answers.”</p>

<p>As Barbara read the message he saw her pleasure in
the quick compression of her lips, the glow in her cheeks,
and then the bright glint of her bronze-brown eyes as
she finished.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly right. I didn’t know just how to
manage such a thing, but I see that that is the proper
method.”</p>

<p>“Yes; the sheriff must have his full opportunity to
act.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“And what, then, if the sheriff refuses to do anything?”</p>

<p>“Then—then”—and Griswold’s jaw set firmly, and
he straightened himself slightly before he added in a
quiet tone—“then I’m going down there to take charge
of the thing myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is too much! I <i>didn’t</i> ask that; and I
must refuse to let you take any such responsibility on
yourself, to say nothing of the personal danger. I merely
wanted your advice—as a lawyer, for the reason that I
dared not risk father’s name even among his best friends
here. And your coming to the office this morning seemed
so—so providential——”</p>

<p>He sought at once to minimize the value of his services,
for he was not a man to place a woman under obligations,
and, moreover, an opportunity like this, to uphold
the dignity, and perhaps to exercise the power, of a
state laid strong hold upon him. He knew little enough
about the Appleweight case, but he felt from his slight
knowledge that he was well within his rights in putting
spurs to the sheriff of Mingo County. If the sheriff failed
to respond in proper spirit and it became necessary to
use the militia, he was conscious that serious complications
might arise. He had not only a respect for law,
but an ideal of civic courage and integrity, and the
governor’s inexplicable absence aroused his honest wrath.
The idea that a mere girl should be forced to sustain
the official honour and dignity of a cowardly father
further angered him. And then he looked into her eyes
and saw how grave they were, and how earnest and with
what courage she met the situation; and the charm of
her slender figure, that glint of gold in her hair, her slim,
supple hands folded on the table—these things wrought
in him a happiness that he had never known before, so
that he laughed as he took the telegram from her.</p>

<p>“There must be no mistake, no failure,” she said
quietly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“We are not going to fail; we are going to carry this
through! Within three days we’ll have Appleweight in
a North Carolina jail or a flying fugitive in Governor
Dangerfield’s territory. And now these telegrams must
be sent. It might be better for you to go to the telegraph
office with me. You must remember that I am
a pilgrim and a stranger, and they might question my
filing official messages.”</p>

<p>“That is perfectly true. I will go into town with
you.”</p>

<p>“And if there’s an official coach that everybody knows
as yours, it would allay suspicions to have it,” and
while he was still speaking she vanished to order the
carriage.</p>

<p>In five minutes it was at the side door, and Griswold
and Barbara, fortified by the presence of Phœbe, left
the governor’s study.</p>

<p>“If they don’t know me, everybody in South Carolina
knows Phœbe,” said Barbara.</p>

<p>“A capital idea. I can see by her eye that she’s built
for conspiracy.”</p>

<p>Griswold’s horse was to be returned to town by a
boy; and when this had been arranged the three entered
the carriage.</p>

<p>“The telegraph office, Tom; and hurry.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />


<small>AN AFFAIR AT THE STATE HOUSE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span> filed the messages herself with the manager of
the telegraph company, who lifted the green shade from
his eyes and smiled upon her.</p>

<p>“We’ll rush them, Miss Osborne. Shall I telephone
the answers if they come to-night? No; your father
likes his telegrams delivered, I remember.”</p>

<p>“I will call for them,” said Griswold. “Governor
Osborne was only at home a few hours this evening, and
he left me in charge of these matters.”</p>

<p>The manager’s face expressed surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh! I didn’t know the governor was at home,” he
remarked, as he finished counting the words and charging
them against the state’s account. “I will send them
myself, and ask the operators at the other end to look
lively about the answers. You are Mr.——”</p>

<p>“This is Major Griswold,” said Barbara, conferring the
title with a vague feeling that it strengthened her cause.</p>

<p>“Major,” repeated the manager, as he nodded to
Griswold with an air that implied his familiarity with
official secrets. “You will call? In a couple of hours,
Major.”</p>

<p>As Barbara and Griswold turned to leave, a young
man who had been writing a message at the standing
desk in the lobby lifted his hat and addressed Barbara.
He was a reporter for the Columbia <i>Intelligencer</i>, and
his manner was eager.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Oh, Miss Osborne, pardon me, but I’ve been trying
to get you on the telephone. Can you tell me where
your father is to-night?”</p>

<p>“Father was in town only a few hours, and then left
on state business.”</p>

<p>The young man glanced from one to the other. He
was a polite youngster, and Miss Barbara Osborne was—Miss
Barbara Osborne, and this, to the people of South
Carolina, was a fact of weight. Still the reporter twirled
his hat uncertainly.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I had met all the trains, but I guess
I missed the governor.”</p>

<p>“No; you didn’t miss him,” smiled Barbara. “Father
drove in from the country and went back the same way.
He didn’t come into town at all.”</p>

<p>The news instinct is the keenest with which man may
be blessed, and the reporter scented events. Griswold,
seeing the light flash in the young man’s eye, felt that
here was an opportunity to allay public criticism.</p>

<p>“Governor Osborne is engaged upon important public
business. He will be absent from town for a day—perhaps
a week. He will not return to Columbia until the
business is thoroughly disposed of.”</p>

<p>“May I ask if it’s the Appleweight case? The Raleigh
papers have wired for information, and we’d like to
know here.”</p>

<p>“I cannot answer that question. It’s enough that the
governor is absent on state business, and that the business
is important. You may print that in the <i>Intelligencer</i>,
and repeat it to Raleigh.—There is no harm in
that, is there, Miss Osborne?”</p>

<p>“No; certainly not,” Barbara replied.</p>

<p>“But the papers all over the state are talking about
the Appleweight gang. They intimate that those people
enjoy immunity from prosecution, and that the governor—you
will pardon me, Miss Osborne—will take no steps
to arrest them, for personal reasons.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“Your question is quite proper,” replied Griswold.
“The governor’s acts are subject to scrutiny at all times,
and it is just as well to have this matter understood now.
I am employed by the governor as special counsel in
some state matters. My name is Griswold. Take out
your book and come to the desk here, and I will give
you a statement which you may publish as by the
authority of the governor.”</p>

<p>The three found seats at a table, and Griswold dictated
while the reporter wrote, Barbara meanwhile sitting with
her cheek resting against her raised hand. She was
experiencing the relief we all know, of finding a strong
arm to lean upon in an emergency, and she realized that
Griswold was not only wise, but shrewd and resourceful.</p>

<p>“Please print this exactly as I give it: It having been
intimated in certain quarters that the Appleweight gang
of outlaws, which has been terrorizing the North Carolina
frontier for several years, enjoys immunity from
prosecution in South Carolina owing to the fact that
Governor Osborne was at some time attorney for Appleweight,
Governor Osborne begs to say that steps have
already been taken for the arrest of this man and his
followers, dead or alive. The governor presents his compliments
to those amiable critics who have so eagerly
seized upon this pretext for slurring his private character
and aspersing his official acts. The governor has
no apologies to proffer the people of South Carolina,
who have so generously reposed in him their trust and
confidence. He is intent upon safeguarding the peace,
dignity, and honour of the state through an honest enforcement
of law, and he has no other aim or ambition.”</p>

<p>Griswold took the reporter’s notebook and read over
this <i>pronunciamiento</i>; then he handed it to Barbara,
who studied it carefully.</p>

<p>“I think that sounds just right, only why not substitute
for ‘honest’ the word ‘vigorous’?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Excellent,” assented Griswold, and thus amended
the statement was returned to the reporter.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Griswold to the young man, “you are
getting a pretty good item that no other paper will have.
Please wire your story to Raleigh; Governor Osborne is
very anxious that the people up there shall understand
fully his attitude in the Appleweight matter.”</p>

<p>“I reckon this will wake up old Dangerfield all right,”
said the reporter, grinning. “He’ll be paralyzed. May
I use your name in this connection, sir?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. My engagement with Governor Osborne
is of the most confidential character, and our purposes
would be defeated by publicity. Remember, you get the
exclusive use of this story—the return and immediate
departure of the governor, his statement to the people
in the Appleweight case—all with the understanding that
you use what you have to the best advantage.”</p>

<p>“This is all right, is it, Miss Osborne?” asked the
reporter.</p>

<p>“Major Griswold has full authority to act, and you
need question nothing he tells you,” Barbara replied.</p>

<p>“I suppose the governor didn’t see the attorney-general
to-day?” asked the reporter detainingly, as
Barbara rose. She exchanged a glance with Griswold.</p>

<p>“Father didn’t see Mr. Bosworth at all, if that’s what
you mean!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t see him? Well, Bosworth didn’t exactly tell
me he had seen him to-day, but I asked him about the
Appleweight case an hour ago at his house, and he said
the governor wasn’t going to do anything, and that
was the end of it so far as the administration is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Print his story and see what happens! We have
no comment to make on that, have we, Miss Osborne?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” replied Barbara scornfully.</p>

<p>“I’m at the Saluda House at present. See me to-morrow
and I may have another story for you!” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Griswold shook the reporter warmly by the hand as
they parted at the carriage door.</p>

<p>“Home,” said Barbara for the reporter’s benefit, and
then, to Griswold: “I must speak of another matter.
Drive with me a little way until we can throw the reporter
off.”</p>

<p>She spoke quietly, but he saw that she was preoccupied
with some new phase of the situation, and as the carriage
gained headway she said earnestly,—</p>

<p>“That young man told the truth—I am sure of it—about
Mr. Bosworth. I knew he would do something to
injure father if he could, but I did not know he had the
courage to go so far.”</p>

<p>“It’s only politics, Miss Osborne,” said Griswold
lightly. “Besides, you may be sure the <i>Intelligencer</i> will
print the governor’s side of it in its largest type.”</p>

<p>“No; it is not politics. It is more despicable, more
contemptible, more ungenerous even than politics. But
he shall be punished, humiliated, for his conduct.”</p>

<p>“You shall fix his punishment yourself!” laughed
Griswold; “but the state’s business first. We have a
little more to do before I am satisfied with the day’s
work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. We must leave nothing undone that
father would do were he here to act for himself.”</p>

<p>“We must be even more careful in his absence to safeguard
his honour than the case really requires. We not
only have his public responsibility but our own into the
bargain in so far as we speak and act for him. And
there’s always the state—the Palmetto flag must be kept
flying at the masthead.” Their eyes met as they passed
under an electric lamp, and he saw how completely she
was relying on his guidance.</p>

<p>They were now at the edge of town, and she bade
him stop the carriage.</p>

<p>“We must go to the state house,” said Griswold.
“We must get that requisition, to guard against treason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
in the citadel. Assuming that Governor Osborne really
doesn’t want to see Appleweight punished, we’d better
hold the requisition anyhow. It’s possible that your
father had it ready—do pardon me!—for a grand-stand
play, or he may have wanted to bring Appleweight into
the friendlier state—but that’s all conjectural. We’d
better keep out of the principal streets. That reporter
has a sharp eye.”</p>

<p>She gave the necessary directions, and the driver
turned back into Columbia. It was pleasant to find his
accomplice in this conspiracy a girl of keen wit who
did not debate matters or ask tiresome questions. The
business ahead was serious enough, though he tried by
manner, tone, and words to minimize its gravity. If
the attorney-general was serving a personal spite, or
whatever the cause of his attitude, he might go far in
taking advantage of the governor’s absence. Griswold’s
relation to the case was equivocal enough, he fully
realized; but the very fact of its being without precedent,
and so beset with pitfalls for all concerned, was a
spur to action. In the present instance a duly executed
requisition for the apprehension of a criminal, which
could not be replaced if lost, must be held at all hazards,
and Griswold had determined to make sure of the governor’s
warrant before he slept.</p>

<p>“Have you the office keys?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; I have been afraid to let go of them. There’s
a watchman in the building, but he knows me very
well. There will not be the slightest trouble about getting
in.”</p>

<p>The watchman—an old Confederate veteran—sat
smoking in the entrance, and courteously bade them
good-evening.</p>

<p>“I want to get some papers from father’s office,
Captain.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Miss Barbara.” He preceded them, throwing
on the lights, to the governor’s door, which he opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
with his own pass-key. “It’s pretty lonesome here at
night, Miss Barbara.”</p>

<p>“I suppose nobody comes at night,” remarked Griswold.</p>

<p>“Not usually, sir. But one or two students are at
work in the library, and Mr. Bosworth is in his office.”</p>

<p>The veteran walked away jingling his keys. Barbara
was already in the private office, bending over the governor’s
desk. She found the right key, drew out a drawer,
then cried out softly. She knelt beside the desk, throwing
the papers about in her eagerness, then turned to
Griswold with a white face.</p>

<p>“The drawer has been opened since I was here this
morning. The requisition and all the other papers in
the case are gone.”</p>

<p>Griswold examined the lock carefully and pointed to
the roughened edges of the wood.</p>

<p>“A blade of the shears there, or perhaps the paper-cutter—who
knows? The matter is simple enough, so
please do not trouble about it. Wait here a moment.
I want to make some inquiries of the watchman.”</p>

<p>He found the old fellow pacing the portico like a
sentry. He pointed out the attorney-general’s office,
threw on a few additional lights for Griswold’s guidance,
and resumed his patrol duty outside.</p>

<p>The attorney-general’s door was locked, but in response
to Griswold’s knock it was opened guardedly.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to trouble you, Mr. Bosworth,” began
Griswold, quietly edging his way into the room, “but
one never gets wholly away from business these days.”</p>

<p>He closed the door himself, and peered into the inner
rooms to be sure the attorney-general was alone. Bosworth’s
face flushed angrily when he found that a
stranger had thus entered his office with a cool air of
proprietorship; then he stared blankly at Griswold for
a moment before he recalled where he had seen him
before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“I don’t receive visitors at night,” he blurted, laying
his hand on the door. “I’m engaged, and you’ll have
to come in office hours.”</p>

<p>He shook the door as though to call Griswold’s attention
to it.</p>

<p>“Do you see this thing? it’s the door!” he roared.</p>

<p>“I have seen it from both sides, Mr. Bosworth. I
intend to stay on this side until I get ready to go.”</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you? What do you mean by
coming here at this time of night?”</p>

<p>“I’m a lawyer myself, if you will force the ignoble
truth from me. Now, when you are perfectly quiet,
and once more the sane, reasonable human being you
must be to have been trusted with the office you hold,
we’ll proceed to business. Meanwhile, please put on
your coat. A man in his shirt-sleeves is always at a
disadvantage; and we Virginians are sticklers for the
proprieties.”</p>

<p>The attorney-general’s fury abated when he saw that
he had to deal with a low-voiced young man who seemed
unlikely to yield to intimidation. Griswold had, in fact,
seated himself on a table that was otherwise covered
with law books, and he sniffed with pleasure the familiar
atmosphere of dusty law calf, which no one who has
had the slightest acquaintance with a law office ever
forgets. To his infinite amusement Bosworth was actually
putting on his coat, though it may have been a
little absent-mindedly to give him an opportunity to
decide upon a plan for getting rid of his visitor. However
this may have been, Bosworth now stepped to the
side of the room and snatched down the telephone
receiver.</p>

<p>Griswold caught him by the shoulder and flung him
round.</p>

<p>“None of that! By calling the police you will only
get yourself into trouble. I’m bigger than you are, and
I should hate to have to throw you out of the window.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Now”—and he caught and hung up the receiver, which
was wildly banging the wall—“now let us be sensible
and get down to business.”</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you?” demanded Bosworth,
glaring.</p>

<p>“I’m special counsel for Governor Osborne in the
Appleweight case. There’s no use in wasting time in
further identification, but if you take down that volume
on Admiralty Practice just behind you, you will find
my name on the title-page. Or, to save you the trouble,
as you seem to be interested in my appearance, I will
tell you that my name is Griswold, and that my address
is Charlottesville, Virginia.”</p>

<p>“You are undoubtedly lying. If you are smart enough
to write a book, you ought to know enough about legal
procedure to understand that the attorney-general represents
the state, and special counsel would not be chosen
without his knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to correct you, my learned brother. You
should never misquote the opposing counsel—it’s one of
the rules of the game. What I said a moment ago was
that I represented the governor—Governor Osborne. I
didn’t say I represented the state, which is a different
matter, and beset with <i>ultra vires</i> pitfalls. There is no
earthly reason why a governor should not detach himself,
so to speak, from his office and act <i>in propria persona</i>,
as a mere citizen. His right to private remedy
is not abridged by the misfortune of office-holding.
Whether he can himself be made defendant in an action
at law touches that ancient question, whether the
monarch or the state can be sued. That’s a question
law students have debated from the beginning of time,
but we must not confuse it with the case at issue. The
governor, as a citizen, may certainly employ such counsel
as he pleases, and just now I represent him. Of course,
if you want me to furnish a brief——”</p>

<p>Griswold’s manner was deliberate and ingratiating.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
He saw that the attorney-general had not the slightest
sense of humour, and that his play upon legal phrases
was wasted. Bosworth grinned, but not at the legal
status of monarchs and states. He had thought of a
clever stroke, and he dealt the blow with confidence.</p>

<p>“Let us assume,” he said, “that you represent Mr.
Osborne. May I ask the whereabouts of your client?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. You may ask anything you please, but
it will do you no good. It’s an old rule of the game
never to divulge a client’s secret. Governor Osborne has
his own reasons for absenting himself from his office.
However, he was at home to-night.”</p>

<p>“I rather guess not, as I had all the trains watched.
You’ll have to do a lot better than that, Mr. Griswold.”</p>

<p>“He has issued a statement to the public since you
lied to the <i>Intelligencer</i> reporter about him to-day. I
suppose it’s part of your official duty to misrepresent
the head of the state administration in the press, but the
governor is in the saddle, and I advise you to be good.”</p>

<p>The attorney-general felt that he was not making
headway. His disadvantage in dealing with a stranger
whose identity he still questioned angered him. He did
not know why Griswold had sought him out, and he
was chagrined at having allowed himself to be so easily
cornered.</p>

<p>“You seem to know a good deal,” he sneered. “How
did you get into this thing anyhow?”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, I was chosen by the governor because
of my superior attainments, don’t you see? But I’m in
a hurry now. I came here on a particular errand. I
want that requisition in the Appleweight case—quick!—if
you please, Mr. Bosworth.”</p>

<p>He jumped down from the table and took up his hat
and stick.</p>

<p>“Mr. Griswold, or whoever you are, you are either a
fool or a blackguard. There isn’t any requisition for
Appleweight. The governor never had the sand to issue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
any, if you must know the truth! If you knew anything
about the governor, you would know that that’s why
Osborne is hiding himself. He can’t afford to offend the
Appleweights, if you must know the disagreeable truth.
Your coming here and asking me for that requisition is
funny, if you had the brains to see it. Poor old Osborne
is scared to death, and I doubt if he’s within a hundred
miles of here. You don’t know the governor; I do!
He’s a dodger, a trimmer, and a coward.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bosworth,” began Griswold deliberately, “that
requisition, duly signed and bearing the seal of the secretary
of state as by the statutes in such cases made and
provided, was in Governor Osborne’s desk this morning
at the time you were so daintily kicking the door in
your anxiety to see the governor. It has since been
taken from the drawer where the governor left it when
he went to New Orleans. You have gone in there like
a sneak-thief, pried open the drawer, and stolen that
document; and now——”</p>

<p>“It’s an ugly charge,” mocked the attorney-general.</p>

<p>“It’s all of that,” and Griswold smiled.</p>

<p>“But you forget that you represent Mr. Osborne. On
the other hand, I represent Governor Osborne, and if
I want the Appleweight papers I had every right to
them.”</p>

<p>“After office hours, feloniously and with criminal
intent?” laughed Griswold.</p>

<p>“We will assume that I have them,” sneered Bosworth,
“and such being the case I will return them only to the
governor.”</p>

<p>“Then”—and Griswold’s smile broadened—“if it
comes to concessions, I will grant that you are within
your rights in wishing to place them in the governor’s
own hands. The governor of South Carolina is now,
so to speak, <i>in camera</i>.”</p>

<p>“The governor is hiding. He’s afraid to come to
Columbia, and the whole state knows it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“The papers, my friend; and I will satisfy you that
the governor of South Carolina is under this roof and
transacting business.”</p>

<p>“Here in the state house?” demanded Bosworth, and
he blanched and twisted the buttons of his coat nervously.</p>

<p>“The governor of South Carolina, the supreme power
of the state, charged with full responsibility, enjoying
all the immunities, rights, and privileges unto him
belonging.”</p>

<p>It was clear that Bosworth took no stock whatever in
Griswold’s story; but Griswold’s pretended employment
by the governor and his apparent knowledge of the
governor’s affairs piqued his curiosity. If this was really
the Griswold who had written a widely accepted work
on admiralty and who was known to him by reputation
as a brilliant lawyer of Virginia, the mystery was all the
deeper. By taking the few steps necessary to reach the
governor’s chambers he would prove the falsity of Griswold’s
pretensions to special knowledge of the governor’s
whereabouts and plans. He stepped to an inner
office, came back with a packet of papers, and thrust a
revolver into his pocket with so vain a show of it that
Griswold laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“What! Do you still back your arguments with firearms
arms down here? It’s a method that has gone out of
fashion in Virginia!”</p>

<p>“If there’s a trick in this it will be the worse for you,”
scowled Bosworth.</p>

<p>“And pray, remember, on your side, that you are to
give those documents into the hands of the governor.
Come along.”</p>

<p>They met the watchman in the corridor, and he saluted
them and passed on. Bosworth strode eagerly forward
in his anxiety to prick the bubble of Griswold’s pretensions.</p>

<p>Griswold threw open the door of the governor’s reception-room,
and they blinked in the stronger light that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
poured in from the private office. There, in the governor’s
chair by the broad official desk, sat Barbara Osborne
reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>“Your Excellency,” said Griswold, bowing gravely and
advancing, “I beg to present the attorney-general.”</p>

<p>“Barbara!”</p>

<p>The papers fell from the attorney-general’s hands.
He stood staring until astonishment began to yield to
rage as he realized that a trap had been sprung upon
him. The girl had risen instantly, and a smile played
about her lips for a moment. She had vaguely surmised
that Griswold would charge Bosworth with the loss of
the papers, but her associate in the conspiracy had now
given a turn to the matter that amused her.</p>

<p>“Barbara!” blurted the attorney-general, “what game
is this—what contemptible trick is this stranger playing
on you? Don’t you understand that your father’s
absence is a most serious matter, and that in the present
condition of this Appleweight affair it is likely to involve
him and the state in scandal?”</p>

<p>Barbara regarded him steadily for a moment with a
negative sort of gaze. She took a step forward before
she spoke, and then she asked quickly and sharply,—</p>

<p>“What have you done, Mr. Bosworth, to avert these
calamities, and what was in your mind when you pried
open the drawer and took out those papers?”</p>

<p>“I was going to use the requisition——”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Why, I expected——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bosworth expected to effect a <i>coup</i> for his own
glory during the governor’s absence,” suggested Griswold.</p>

<p>“How?” and Barbara’s voice rang imperiously and
her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“Send this unknown person, this impostor and meddler
away, and I will talk to you as old friends may talk together,”
and he glared fiercely at Griswold, who stood
fanning himself with his hat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“I asked you how you intended to serve my father,
Mr. Bosworth, because you sent me this afternoon a
letter in which you threatened me—you threatened me
with my father’s ruin if I did not marry you. You
would take advantage of my trouble and anxiety to
force that question on me when I had answered it once
and for all long ago. Before this stranger I want to
tell you that you are a despicable coward, and that if
you think you can humiliate me or my father or the
state by such practices as you have resorted to you are
very greatly mistaken. And further, Mr. Bosworth, if
I find you interfering again in this matter, I shall print
that letter you wrote me to-day in every newspaper in
the state! Now, that is all I have to say to you, and I
hope never to see you again.”</p>

<p>“Before you go, Mr. Bosworth,” said Griswold, “I
wish to say that Miss Osborne has spoken of your conduct
with altogether too much restraint. I shall add, on
my own account, that if I find you meddling again in
this Appleweight case, I shall first procure your removal
from office, and after that I shall take the greatest pleasure
in flogging you within an inch of your life. Now
go!”</p>

<p>The two had dismissed him, and before Bosworth’s
step died away in the hall, Griswold was running his
eye over the papers.</p>

<p>“That man will do something nasty if he is clever
enough to think of anything.”</p>

<p>“He’s a disgusting person,” said Barbara, touching
her forehead with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“He’s all of that,” remarked Griswold, as he retied the
red tape round the packet of papers. “And now, before
we leave we may as well face a serious proposition. Your
father’s absence and this fiction we are maintaining that
he is really here cannot be maintained for ever. I don’t
want to trouble you, for you, of course, realize all this
as keenly as I. But what do you suppose actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
happened at New Orleans between your father and the
governor of North Carolina?”</p>

<p>She leaned against her father’s desk, her hands lightly
resting on its flat surface. She was wholly serene now,
and she smiled and then laughed.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been what the governor of North
Carolina said to the governor of South Carolina in the
old story, for father is strongly opposed to drink of all
kinds. And in the story——”</p>

<p>“I’ve forgotten where that story originated.”</p>

<p>“Well, it happened a long time ago, and nobody really
knows the origin. But according to tradition, at the
crisis of a great row between two governors, the ice
was broken by the governor of North Carolina saying to
the governor of South Carolina those shocking words
about its being a long time between drinks. What makes
the New Orleans incident so remarkable is that father
and Governor Dangerfield have always been friends,
though I never cared very much for the Dangerfields
myself. The only tiffs they have had have been purely
for effect. When father said that the people of North
Carolina would never amount to anything so long as
they fry their meat, it was only his joke with Governor
Dangerfield—but it did make North Carolina awfully
mad. And Jerry—she’s the governor’s daughter—refused
to visit me last winter just on that account.
Jerry Dangerfield’s a nice little girl, but she has no
sense of humour.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />


<small>THE LABOURS OF MR. ARDMORE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> he waited for Miss Jerry Dangerfield to appear
Mr. Thomas Ardmore read for the first time the constitution
of the United States. He had reached the
governor’s office early, and seeking diversion, he had
picked up a small volume that bore some outward resemblance
to a novel. This proved, however, to be
Johnston’s <i>American Politics</i>, and he was amazed to
find that this diminutive work contained the answers
to a great many questions which had often perplexed
him, but which he had imagined could not be answered
except by statesmen or by men like his friend Griswold,
who spent their lives in study.</p>

<p>He had supposed that the constitution of a great
nation like the United States would fill many volumes,
and be couched in terms bewildering and baffling; and
it was perhaps the proudest moment in Mr. Ardmore’s
life when, in the cool and quiet of the May morning, in
the historic chambers of the governor of North Carolina,
it dawned upon him that the charter of American liberty
filled hardly more space than the stipulations for a
yacht race, or a set of football rules; and that, moreover,
he understood the greater part of it, or thought he
did. Such strange words as “attainder” and “capitation”
he sought out in the dictionary, and this also gave
him a new sensation and thrill of pleasure at finding the
machinery of knowledge so simple. He made note of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
several matters he wished to ask Griswold about when
they met again; then turned back into the body
of the text, and had read as far as Burr’s conspiracy
when Jerry came breezily in. He experienced for the
first time in his life that obsession of guilt which sinks in
shame the office-boy who is caught reading a dime novel.
Jerry seemed to tower above him like an avenging angel,
and though her sword was only a parasol, her words cut
deep enough.</p>

<p>“Well, you are taking it pretty cool!”</p>

<p>“Taking what?” faltered Ardmore, standing up, and
seeking to hide the book behind his back.</p>

<p>“Why, this outrageous article!” and she thrust a
newspaper under his eyes. “Do you mean to say you
haven’t seen the morning paper?”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Miss Dangerfield, I hardly ever
read the papers.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you were reading when I came in?”
she demanded severely, withholding the paper until she
should be answered.</p>

<p>“It’s a book about the government, and the powers
reserved to the states and that sort of thing. I was just
reading the constitution; I thought it might help us—I
mean <i>you</i>—in your work.”</p>

<p>“The constitution help me? Hasn’t it occurred to
you before this that what I’m doing is all against the
constitution and the revised statutes and all those books
you see on the shelf there?”</p>

<p>“But the constitution sounds all right. It seems
remarkably reasonable. You couldn’t ask anything
fairer than that!”</p>

<p>“So are the ten commandments fair enough; but
you’re on the wrong track, Mr. Ardmore, if you’re trying
to support the present administration with stupid
things in books. I don’t follow precedents, Mr. Ardmore;
I create them.”</p>

<p>“But I should think you would have to be awfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
careful not to mix up the business of the executive and
judicial branches of the government. I think I heard
Grissy speak of that once, though I’m not certain.
Grissy knows more than almost any other living
man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that your friend is a well-educated
person, but in times like these you’ve got to rise above
the constitution; and just now it’s more convenient to
forget it. There’s a constitution of North Carolina, too,
if you’re looking for constitutions, but in good society
such things are not mentioned. Papa always refers to
the constitution with tears in his eyes when he’s making
speeches, but papa’s very emotional. If I could make a
speech I should tell the people what I think of them—that
they’re too silly and stupid for words.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Miss Dangerfield. I have felt exactly
that way about the people ever since I was defeated for
alderman in New York. But let me have the paper.”</p>

<p>She turned to the morning mail while he read and
opened the envelopes rapidly. Such of the letters as she
thought interesting or important she put aside, and when
Ardmore finished reading a double-leaded telegram from
Columbia, in which the governor of South Carolina was
quoted as declaring his intention of taking immediate
steps for the apprehension of Appleweight, she was still
reading and sorting letters, tapping her cheek lightly
meanwhile with the official paper-knife.</p>

<p>“Here, Mr. Ardmore,” she said, drawing a paper from
her pocket, “is the answer to that telegram we sent
yesterday evening. Suppose you read that next, and
we can then decide what to do.”</p>

<p>She was making the letters into little piles, humming
softly meanwhile; but he felt that there was a storm
brewing. He read the message from Columbia a number
of times, and if the acting governor had not been so
ominously quiet he would have laughed at the terse
sentences.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“There must be a mistake about this. He wouldn’t
have used ‘diverting’ that way; that’s insulting!”</p>

<p>“So you appreciate its significance, do you, Mr. Ardmore?
The iron enters your soul, does it? You realize
that I have been insulted, do you?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t put it that way, Miss Dangerfield.
Governor Osborne would never have sent a message like
that to you—he thought he was sending it to your
father.”</p>

<p>“He’s insulted me and every other citizen in the Old
North State; that’s who he’s insulted, Mr. Ardmore.
Let me read it again;” and she repeated the telegram
aloud:</p>

<p>“‘Your extremely diverting telegram in Appleweight
case received and filed.’ I think it’s the <i>extremely</i> that’s
so perfectly mean. The <i>diverting</i> by itself would not
hurt my feelings half so much. He’s a good deal smarter
man than I thought he was to think up a telegram like
that. But what do you think of that piece in the newspaper?”</p>

<p>“He says he’s going to catch Appleweight dead or
alive. That sounds pretty serious.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a bluff myself. That telegram we sent
him yesterday must have scared him to death. He was
driven into a corner and had to do something to avoid
being disgraced, and it’s easy enough to talk big in the
newspapers when you haven’t the slightest intention of
doing anything at all. I’ve noticed that father talks
the longest and loudest about things he doesn’t believe
at all.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” whispered Ardmore incredulously.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s possible! Father would never have
been elected if he’d expressed his real sentiments; neither
would anybody else ever be elected if he said beforehand
what he really believed.”</p>

<p>“That must have been the reason I got defeated for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
alderman on the reform ticket. I told ’em I was for
turning the rascals out.”</p>

<p>“That was very stupid of you. You’ve got to get
the rascals to elect you first; then if you’re tired of
office and don’t need them any more you bounce them.
But that’s political practice; it’s a theory we’ve got to
work out now. Governor Osborne’s telegram is much
more important than his interview in the newspapers,
which is just for effect and of no importance at all. He
doesn’t say the same things in the telegram to father
that he said to the reporter. A governor who really
meant to do anything wouldn’t be so ready to insult
another governor. The newspapers are a lot of bother.
I spent all yesterday evening talking to reporters. They
came to the house to ask where papa was and when he
would be home!”</p>

<p>“What did you tell them?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell them anything. I sent out for two other
girls, and we all just talked to them and kept talking,
and gave them lemon sherbet and ginger cookies; and
Eva Hungerford played the banjo—you don’t know
Eva? Of course you don’t know anybody, and I don’t
want you to, for it would spoil you for private secretary.
But Eva is simply killing when she gets to cutting up,
and we made those reporters sing to us, and all they say
in the papers, even the opposition papers, this morning
is that Governor Dangerfield is in Savannah visiting
an old friend. They all tell the same story, so they
must have fixed it up after they left the house. But
what were you doing, Mr. Ardmore, that you didn’t
come around to help? It seems to me you don’t appreciate
the responsibilities of being secretary to a
governor.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid you might scold me if I did. And besides
I was glued to the long distance telephone all
evening, talking to my manager at Ardsley. He read
me my letters and a lot of telegrams that annoyed me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
very much. I wish you wouldn’t be so hard on me,
for I have trifling troubles of my own.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose you ever had troubles; you certainly
don’t act as though you ever had.”</p>

<p>“No one who has never been brother-in-law to a duke
has the slightest idea of what trouble is.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen the Duke of Ballywinkle’s picture in the
papers, and he looks very attractive.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’d ever seen him eat celery you’d change
your mind. He’s going down to Ardsley to visit me; for
sheer nerve I must say my relations beat the world. I
got my place over here in North Carolina just to get
away from them, and now my sister—not the duchess,
but Mrs. Atchison—is coming down there with a lot of
girls, and Ballywinkle has attached himself to the party.
They’ll pass through here to-day, and they’ll expect to
find me at Ardsley.”</p>

<p>“If the duke’s really coming to our state I suppose
we ought to recognize him officially,” and Jerry’s eyes
were large with reverie as she pondered her possible
duty.</p>

<p>“Do something for him!” blazed Ardmore. “I hope
<i>you</i> don’t labour under the delusion that a duke’s any
better than anybody else? If you’d suffered what I have
from being related to a duke you’d be sorry to hear he
was even passing through your state, much less stopping
off for a couple of weeks.”</p>

<p>“Because you don’t like him is no reason why every
one else should feel the same way, is it? I’ve read about
the Duke of Ballywinkle, and he belongs to one of the
oldest families in England, and I’ve seen pictures of
Ballywinkle Castle——”</p>

<p>“Worse than that,” grinned Ardmore, with rising
humour, “I had to chip in to pay for it! And the
plumbing isn’t yet what it ought to be. The last time
I was over there I caught cold and nearly died of pneumonia.
I make it a rule now never to visit dukes. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
never know what you’ll strike when you stay in those
ancestral castles, even when they’ve been restored with
some silly American girl’s grandfather’s money. Those
places are all full of draughts and malaria and ghosts, and
they make you drink tea in the afternoon, which is worse
than being haunted.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we might invite his Grace to inspect our
militia,” persisted Jerry. “It would sound well in the
papers to have a real duke inspect the North Carolina
troops.”</p>

<p>“It would sound better than he would look doing it,
I can tell you that. Old Wellington may have been all
right, but these new dukes were never made for horseback.”</p>

<p>“He might appear in a carriage, wearing his orders
and ride the lines that way, with all the troops presenting
arms.”</p>

<p>“Or you might pin his debts on him and mount him
on a goat on the rifle-range and let the sharpshooters
pepper away at him! Please let us not talk about Ballywinkle
any more; the thought of him gives me that
sinking feeling.”</p>

<p>He had opened an atlas and was poring over it with
a magnifying glass.</p>

<p>“It’s positively funny,” he murmured, laughing a
little to himself, “but I know something about this
country over here. Here’s Ardsley, in the far corner
of Dilwell County, and here’s Kildare.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I understand maps. Dilwell is green, and
there’s the state line, and that ugly watery sort of yellow
is Mingo County, South Carolina, and Turner Court
House is the county seat of it. Those little black marks
are hills on the border, and it’s right there that these
Appleweight people live, and dance on the state line as
though it were a skipping-rope.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly it. Now what we want to do is to
arrest Appleweight and put him in jail in South Carolina,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
which relieves the governor of North Carolina, your
honoured father, of all embarrassment.”</p>

<p>She snatched the paper-cutter and took possession of
the map for a moment, then pointed, with a happy little
laugh.</p>

<p>“Why, that will be only too easy. You see there’s
Azbell County, where the militia is encamped, just three
counties away from Dilwell, and if we needed the soldiers
it wouldn’t hurt the troops to march that far, would it?”</p>

<p>“Hurt them, nothing!” exclaimed Ardmore. “It
will be good for them. You have to give orders to the
adjutant-general, and, being engaged to him, he would
be afraid not to obey your orders, even if you told him
to go in balloons.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, I’d send him an official order; and
if he was disobedient I could break our engagement.
When I broke my engagement with Arthur Treadmeasure,
it was only because he was five minutes late coming to
take me to a dance.”</p>

<p>“You were perfectly right, Miss Dangerfield. No
gentleman would keep you waiting.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t keep me waiting! I was sick in bed
with a sore throat, and mamma wouldn’t let me go; but
I thought it was very careless and taking too much for
granted for him to think he could come poking along
any time he pleased, so I ended everything.”</p>

<p>It would have interested Ardmore to know the total
of Miss Dangerfield’s engagements, but the time did not
seem propitious for such inquiries; and, moreover, his
awe of her as a young person of great determination and
force of character increased. She spoke of employing
the armed forces of the state as though playing with the
militia were a cheerful pastime, like horseback riding or
tennis. His heart sank as he foresaw the possibility of
the gallant Gillingwater coming out of the Appleweight
affair with flying colours, a hero knighted on the field
for valour. The remembrance of Gillingwater receiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the salutes of the militia and riding off to the wars to
the beat of drums had deprived Ardmore of sleep all
night.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s the map, and there’s that insulting telegram;
what are you going to do about it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>She seemed to be honestly inviting suggestions, and
the very thought of this affected him like wine. He
deliberated for several minutes, while she watched him.
A delicious country quiet lay upon the old state house;
in the tranquil park outside the birds whistled their
high disdain of law and precedent. It was no small
thing to be identified with a great undertaking like this,
with the finest girl in the world; and he could not help
thinking of the joy of telling Griswold, the sober professor
and sedate lawyer, of this adventure when it
should be happily concluded. Never again should
Grissy taunt him with his supineness before the open
door of opportunity!</p>

<p>“A governor,” he began, “is always a dignified person
who doesn’t bother his head about little things like
this unless everybody else has gone to sleep. Now, who’s
the chief of police in a county like Dilwell—what do you
call him?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the sheriff, Mr. Ardmore?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Now, give me those telegraph blanks,
and I’ll drop him a few lines to let him know that the
government at Raleigh still lives.”</p>

<p>It is in the telegram alone that we Americans approach
style. Our great commanders did much to form it;
our business strategists took the key from them. “I
propose to fight it out on this line, if it takes all summer”
is not more admirable than “Cancel order our number
six hundred and eighteen,” or “Have drawn at sight.”
Through the most familiar and commonplace apparatus
clicks and ticks the great American epic in phrases concise,
unequivocal, and apt. Von Moltke, roused at night
with news of war, merely waved his hand to the long-prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
orders in his chiffonier and went to sleep again;
but the great Prussian has his counterpart in the American
magnate who ties up a railroad by telegraph over
his after-dinner coffee. Telegrams were, however, with
Mr. Thomas Ardmore, something more than a form of
communication or a mere literary exercise. Letter-writing
seemed to him the most formidable of human
undertakings, but with a pad of telegraph blanks under
his hand his spirit soared free. All untrammelled by the
horror of the day tariff, whose steep slopes have wrought
so much confusion and error among the economical, he
gave to the wires and the wireless what he never would
have confided to a stamp. He wrote and submitted to
Miss Jerry Dangerfield the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>To the Sheriff of Dilwell County,<br />
<span class="indentleft3">Kildare, N. C.:</span></p>

<p>What is this I hear about your inability to catch Appleweight and
the rest of his bunch? Your inattention to your duties is a matter
of common scandal, and if you don’t get anxious pretty soon I shall
remove you from your job and then come. I shall be down soon to
see whether you are pitching quoits at the blacksmith shop or fishing
for lobsters in Raccoon Creek, instead of attending to your knitting.
Your conduct has annoyed me until I am something more than vexed
by your behaviour. The eyes of the great North State are upon you.
Wire me at length just what you propose doing or not doing in this
matter.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">William Dangerfield</span>, &#160; &#160; <br />
Governor of North Carolina.</p>
</div>

<p>“What do you think of that?” he asked, his pride
falling as she scanned the paper carefully.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it pretty expensive?” Jerry inquired, counting
the words to ten and then roughly computing the rest.</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of that, Miss Dangerfield. What I
want to know is whether you think that will make the
sheriff sit up.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s what father sent him only about a week
ago. I found it in his private letter book, and it’s
marked confidential in red ink.”</p>

<p>She read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Act cautiously in Appleweight case. Indictment by grand Jury
is undoubtedly faulty, and Foster threatens trouble in case parties
are arrested.’</p>
</div>

<p>“And there’s more like that! Papa never intended
to do anything, that’s as plain as daylight. Mr. Foster,
the treasurer, comes from that county. He thought
papa was going to have to do something, so he’s holding
back the payment of the state bonds just to frighten
papa. You see, the state owes the Bronx Loan and
Trust Company that two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, and if it isn’t paid June first the state will be
everlastingly disgraced.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; I’d forgotten about that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you could forget about it. That
must be almost as much money as there is in the world,
Mr. Ardmore.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to raise it, anyhow, even if we go to the
pawn-shop. I pawned my watch once when I was in
college and Billings—he was my guardian—had shut
me off. Grissy—he’s my friend—Grissy says pawn-broking
is only a more vulgar form of banking. There
was a fellow in my class at college who pawned his pawn-ticket
to get money to pay his laundress, and then gave
the new ticket to a poor blind man. He’s a big man in
Wall Street—has a real genius for finance, they say.
But please don’t worry about this rascal Foster. We’ll
put some digitalis into the state’s credit when the time
comes.”</p>

<p>“I think your telegram to the sheriff is all right,”
said Jerry, reading it again. “If you’ll go to the door
and whistle for the messenger we’ll get it off. I’ll sign
it with the rubber stamp. Papa hardly ever signs anything
himself; he says if you don’t sign documents
yourself you can always repudiate them afterward, and
papa’s given prayerful thought to all such things.”</p>

<p>Ardmore addressed himself once more to the map. It
was clear that the Appleweight gang was powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
enough to topple great states upon their foundations.
It had, to Ardmore’s own knowledge, driven a governor
into exile, and through the wretched Foster, who was
their friend, the credit of the state was gravely menaced.
The possibilities of the game fascinated Ardmore. He
was eager for action on the scene of this usurpation and
defiance. Responsibility, for the first time, had placed
a warrant of trust in his hands, and, thus commissioned,
the spurs of duty pricked his sides.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for the sheriff’s answer, and if he shows no
signs of life I’ll go down there this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Then you will undoubtedly be shot!” Jerry declared,
as though announcing a prospect not wholly deplorable.</p>

<p>“That has its disagreeable side, but a great many
people have to be shot every year to keep up the average,
and if the statistics need me I won’t duck. I’ll call up
my man on the telephone this forenoon and tell him to
put my forester at Ardsley to work. He’s a big fellow
who served in the German army, and if he’s afraid of
anything I haven’t heard of it. If we can drive the
gang into South Carolina, right along here, you see”—and
Miss Dangerfield bent her pretty head over the
map and saw—“if we can pass the chief outlaw on to
Governor Osborne, then so much the better, and that’s
what we will try to do.”</p>

<p>“But you’re only the private secretary, and you can’t
assume too much authority. I shall have to go to Kildare
to visit my aunt, who is a nice old lady that lives
there. The fried corn mush and syrup at her house is
the best I ever tasted, and if papa should come when he
sees that something is being done quite different from
what he intended, then I should be there to explain.
If you should be killed, Mr. Ardmore, no one would be
there to identify you, and I have always thought it
the saddest thing in the world for any one to die away
from home——”</p>

<p>“It would be sad; but I hope you would be sorry.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“I should regret your death, and I’d make them give
you a perfectly beautiful military funeral, with Chopin’s
funeral march, and your boots tied to the saddle of your
horse.”</p>

<p>“But don’t let them fuss about pulling off the boots,
Miss Dangerfield, if I die with them on. It would be
all right for you to visit your aunt, but I shouldn’t do
it if I were you. I once visited my aunt, Mrs. Covington-Burns,
at Newport for a week. It was a deep game
to get me to marry my aunt’s husband’s niece, whose
father had lost his money, and the girl was beginning
to bore my aunt.”</p>

<p>“Was she a pretty girl?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“She was a whole basket of peaches, and I might
have married her to get away from my aunt if it were
not that I have made it a life-long rule never to marry
the orphaned nieces of the husbands of my aunts. It’s
been a good rule to me, and has saved me no end of
trouble. But if my sister doesn’t change her mind, and
if she really comes through Raleigh to-day in her car
with those friends of hers, she will be delighted to have
you join her for a visit at Ardsley. And then you would
be near at hand in case some special edict from the
governor seemed necessary.”</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t your sister think it strange——”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, Miss Dangerfield. Nothing is
strange to my sister. Nobody ever sprang a surprise on
Nellie yet. And besides, you are the daughter of the
governor of a great state. She refuses to meet senators,
because you can never be sure they are respectable, but
she rather prides herself on knowing governors. Governors
are very different. Since I read the constitution
I can see very plainly that governors are much nearer
the people, but I guess the senators are nearer the
banks.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have some shopping to do, and it’s ten
o’clock. It would be hospitable to ask you to luncheon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
but mamma cries so much because she doesn’t know
where papa is that our meals at the executive mansion
are not exactly cheerful functions. And besides”—and
she eyed Ardmore severely as she rose and accepted her
parasol from him—“and besides, you know our relations
are purely official. You have never been introduced
to me, and socially you are not known to us.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />


<small>THE LAND OF THE LITTLE BROWN JUG.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Caboose</span> 0186, with three box-cars and a locomotive
attached, lay in the south-eastern yards at Raleigh late
in the evening of the same day. In the observatory
sat Mr. Thomas Ardmore, chatting with the conductor,
while they waited for the right of way. Mr. Ardmore’s
pockets were filled with papers, and he held half a dozen
telegrams in his hand. The freight cars behind him
were locked and sealed, and a number of men lounging
near appeared to be watching them.</p>

<p>The reply of the sheriff of Dilwell County had precipitated
the crisis. That official succinctly replied to
Ardmore’s message:</p>

<p class="center">Be good and acquire grace.</p>

<p>While this dictum had aroused Miss Dangerfield’s
wrath and indignation, it calmed her fellow-conspirator,
and for hours Ardmore had poured forth orders by telegraph
and telephone. No such messages as his had
ever before radiated from Raleigh. The tolls would have
bankrupted the commonwealth if Ardmore had not
cared for them out of his private purse. His forester,
with an armed posse from Ardsley, was already following
the streams and beating the brush in search of
Appleweight. One car of Ardmore’s special train contained
a machine gun and a supply of rifles; another
abundant ammunition and commissary supplies, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
third cots and bags. The men who loafed about the
train were a detail of strike-breakers from a detective
agency, borrowed for the occasion. Cooke, the conductor
of the train, had formerly been in the government
secret service, and knew the Carolina hill country as he
knew the palm of his hand. Ardmore had warned his
manager and the housekeeper on his estate to prepare
for the arrival of Mrs. Atchison, whose private car had
come and gone, carrying Miss Geraldine Dangerfield on
to Ardsley. Ardmore had just received a message from
his sister at some way station, reporting all well and
containing these sentences: “She is rather different,
and I do not quite make her out. She has our noble
brother-in-law a good deal bewildered.”</p>

<p>Cooke ran forward for a colloquy with the engineer
over their orders; the guards climbed into one of the
box-cars, and the train moved slowly out of the Raleigh
yards to the main line and rattled away toward Kildare,
with Mr. Ardmore, pipe in mouth, perched in the caboose
cupola.</p>

<p>A caboose, you may not know, is the pleasantest place
in the world to ride. Essentially a thing of utility, it
is not less the vehicle of joy. Neither the captain of a
trading schooner nor the admiral of a canal fleet is more
sublimely autocratic than the freight conductor in his
watch-tower. The landscape is disclosed to him in
leisurely panoramas; the springs beneath are not so
lulling as to dull his senses. If he isn’t whipped into the
ditch by the humour of the engineer, or run down and
telescoped by an enemy from behind, he may ultimately
deliver his sombre fleet to its several destinations; but
he is the slave of no inexorable time-table, and his excuses
are as various as his cargoes.</p>

<p>Not Captain Kidd nor another of the dark brotherhood
sailed forth with keener zest for battle than Mr.
Ardmore. Indeed, the trailing smoke of the locomotive
suggested a black flag, and the thought of it tickled his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
fancy. Above bent the bluest sky in the world; fields
of corn and cotton, the brilliant crimson of German
clover, and long stretches of mixed forest held him with
enchantment. In a cornfield a girl ploughing with a
single steer—a little girl in a sunbonnet, who reached
wearily up to the plough handles—paused and waved to
him, and he knew the delight of the lonely mariner
when a passing ship speaks to him with flags. And
when night came, after the long mystical twilight, the
train passed now and then great cotton factories that
blazed out from their thousand windows like huge
steamships.</p>

<p>When they sought a lonely siding to allow a belated
passenger train to pass, the conductor brewed coffee and
cooked supper, and Ardmore called in the detectives and
trainmen. The sense of knowing real people, whose
daily occupations were so novel and interesting, touched
him afresh with delight. These men said much in few
words. The taciturnity of Cooke, the conductor, in
particular, struck Ardmore as very fine, and it occurred
to him that very likely men who have had the fun of
doing things never talk of their performances afterward.
One of the detectives chaffed Cooke covertly
about some adventure in which they had been jointly
associated.</p>

<p>“I never thought they’d get the lead out of you after
that business in Missouri. You were a regular mine,”
said the detective to Cooke, and Cooke glanced deprecatingly
at Ardmore.</p>

<p>“He’s the little joker, all right.”</p>

<p>“You can’t kill him,” remarked the detective. “I’ve
seen it tried.”</p>

<p>Before the train started the detectives crawled back
into their car, and Cooke drew out some blankets, tossed
them on a bench for Ardmore, and threw himself down
without ado. Ardmore held to his post in the tower, as
lone as the lookout in a crow’s-nest. The night air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
swept more coolly in as they neared the hills, and the
train’s single brakeman came down as though descending
from the sky, rubbed the cinders from his eyes, and
returned to his vigil armed with a handful of Ardmore’s
cigars.</p>

<p>For the greater part of the night they enjoyed a free
track, and thumped the rails at a lively clip. Shortly
after midnight Ardmore crawled below and went to
sleep. At five o’clock Cooke called him.</p>

<p>“We’re on the switch at Kildare. One of your men
is here waiting for you.”</p>

<p>Big Paul, the German forester, was called in, and
Ardmore made his toilet in a pail of water while listening
to the big fellow’s report. Cooke joined in the conversation,
and Ardmore was gratified to see that the
two men met on common ground in discussing the local
geography. The forester described in clear, straightforward
English just what he had done. He had distributed
his men well through the hills, and they were
now posted as pickets on points favourable for observation.
They had found along the streams four widely
scattered stills, and these were being watched. Paul
drew a small map, showing the homes of the most active
members of the Appleweight gang, and Ardmore indicated
all these points as nearly as possible on the county
map he had brought with him.</p>

<p>“Here’s Raccoon Creek, and my own land runs right
through there—just about here, isn’t it, Paul? I always
remember the creek, because I like the name so much.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Mr. Ardmore. The best timber you
have lies along there, and your land crosses the North
Carolina boundary into South Carolina about here.
There’s Mingo County, South Carolina, you see.”</p>

<p>“Well, that dashes me!” exclaimed Ardmore, striking
the table with his fist. “I never knew one state from
another, but you must be right.”</p>

<p>“I’m positive of it, Mr. Ardmore. One of my men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
has been living there on the creek to protect your timber.
Some of these outlaws have been cutting off our wood.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me I remember the place. There’s a
log house hanging on the creek. You took me by it
once, but it never entered my head that the state line
was so close.”</p>

<p>“It runs right through the house! And some one,
years ago, blazed the trees along there, so it is very easy
to tell when you step from one state to another. My
man left there recently, refusing to stay any longer.
These Appleweight people thought he was a spy, and
posted a notice on his door warning him to leave, so I
shifted him to the other end of the estate.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the sheriff at Kildare?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him. When I asked for him yesterday
I found he had left town and gone to Greensboro to
see his sick uncle.”</p>

<p>Ardmore laughed and slapped his knee.</p>

<p>“Who takes care of the dungeon while he’s away?”</p>

<p>“There are no prisoners in the Kildare jail. The
sheriff’s afraid to keep any; and he’s like the rest of
the people around here. They all live in terror of Appleweight.”</p>

<p>“Appleweight is a powerful character in these parts,”
said Cooke, pouring the coffee he had been making, and
handing a tin cupful to Ardmore. “He’s tolerable well
off, and could make money honestly if he didn’t operate
stills, rob country stores, mix up in politics, and steal
horses when he and his friends need them.”</p>

<p>“I guess he has never molested us any, has he, Paul?”
asked Ardmore, not a little ashamed of his ignorance of
his own business.</p>

<p>“A few of our cows stray away sometimes and never
come back. And for two years we have lost the corn
out of the crib away over here near the deer park.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got the juice out of it before this,” remarked
Cooke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“That would be nice for me, wouldn’t it?” said Ardmore,
grinning—“to be arrested for running a still on
my place.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to lose our right to the track, and
we must get out of this before the whole community
comes to take a look at us,” said Cooke, swinging out
of the caboose.</p>

<p>Ardmore talked frankly to the forester, having constant
recourse to the map; and Paul sketched roughly a
new chart, marking roads and paths so far as he knew
them, and indicating clearly where the Ardsley boundaries
extended. Then Ardmore took a blue pencil and
drew a straight line.</p>

<p>“When we get Appleweight, we want to hurry him
from Dilwell County, North Carolina, into Mingo County,
South Carolina. We will go to the county town there,
and put him in jail. If the sheriff of Mingo is weak-kneed,
we will lock Appleweight up anyhow, and telegraph
the governor of South Carolina that the joke is
on him.”</p>

<p>“We will catch the man,” said Paul gravely, “but we
may have to kill him.”</p>

<p>“Dead or alive, he’s got to be caught,” said Ardmore,
and the big forester stared at his employer a little oddly;
for this lord proprietor had not been known to his employees
and tenants as a serious character, but rather as
an indolent person who, when he visited his estate in
the hills, locked himself up unaccountably in his library,
and rarely had the energy to stir up the game in his
broad preserves.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; dead or alive,” Paul repeated.</p>

<p>Cooke came out of the station and signalled the engineer
to go ahead.</p>

<p>“We’ll pull down here about five miles to an old
spur where the company used to load wood. There’s a
little valley there where we can be hidden all we please,
so far as the main line is concerned, and it might not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
be a bad idea to establish headquarters there. We have
the tools for cutting in on the telegraph, and we can be
as independent as we please. I told the agent we were
carrying company powder for a blasting job down the
line, and he suspects nothing.”</p>

<p>Paul left the caboose as the train started, and rode
away on horseback to visit his pickets. The train crept
warily over the spur into the old woodcutters’ camp,
where, as Cooke had forecast, they were quite shut in
from the main line by hills and woodland.</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Ardmore, if you would like to see
fire-water spring out of the earth as freely as spring
water, come with me for a little stroll. The thirsty of
Dilwell County know the way to these places as city
topers know the way to a bar. We are now in the land
of the little brown jug, and while these boys get breakfast
I’ll see if the people in this region have changed
their habits.”</p>

<p>It was not yet seven as they struck off into the forest
beside the cheerful little brook that came down singing
from the hills. Ardmore had rarely before in his life
been abroad so early, and he kicked the dew from the
grass in the cheerfullest spirit imaginable. Within a
few days he had reared a pyramid of noble resolutions.
Life at last entertained him. The way of men of action
had been as fabulous to him as the dew that now twinkled
before him. Griswold knew books, but here at his side
strode a man who knew far more amazing things than
were written in any book. Cooke had not been in this
region for seven years, and yet he never hesitated, but
walked steadily on, following the little brook. Presently
he bent over the bank and gathered up a brownish substance
that floated on the water, lifted a little of it in
his palm, and sniffed it.</p>

<p>“That,” said Cooke, holding it to Ardmore’s nose, “is
corn mash. That’s what they make their liquor out of.
The still is probably away up yonder on that hillside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
It seems to me that we smashed one there once when I
was in the service; and over there, about a mile beyond
that pine tree, where you see the hawk circling,
three of us got into a mix-up, and one of our boys was
killed.”</p>

<p>He crossed the stream on a log, climbed the bank on
the opposite shore, and scanned the near landscape for
a few minutes. Then he pointed to an old stump over
which vines had grown in wild profusion.</p>

<p>“If you will, walk to that stump, Mr. Ardmore, and
feel under the vines on the right-hand side, your fingers
will very likely touch something smooth and cool.”</p>

<p>Ardmore obeyed instructions. He thrust his hand
into the stump as Cooke directed, thrust again a little
deeper, and laughed aloud as he drew out a little brown
jug.</p>

<p>Cooke nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>“We’re all right. The revenue men come in here
occasionally and smash the stills and arrest a few men,
but the little brown jug continues to do business at the
same old stand. They don’t even change the hiding-places.
And while we stand here, you may be pretty
sure that a freckled-faced, tow-headed boy or girl is
watching us off yonder, and that the word will pass all
through the hills before noon that there are strangers
abroad in old Dilwell. If you have a dollar handy, slip
it under the stump, so they’ll know we’re not stingy.”</p>

<p>Ardmore was scrutinizing the jug critically.</p>

<p>“They’re all alike,” said Cooke, “but that piece of
calico is a new one—just a fancy touch for an extra fine
article of liquor.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be shot if I haven’t seen that calico before,” said
Ardmore; and he sat down on a boulder and drew out
the stopper, while Cooke watched him with interest.</p>

<p>The bit of twine was indubitably the same that he had
unwound before in his room at the Guilford House, and
the cob parted in his fingers exactly as before. On a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
piece of brown paper that had been part of a tobacco
wrapper was scrawled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This ain’t yore fight, Mr. Ardmore. Wher’s the guvner of North
Carolina?</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s a new one on me,” laughed Cooke. “You see,
they know everything. Mind-reading isn’t in it with
them. They know who we are and what we have come
for. What’s the point about the governor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the governor’s all right,” replied Ardmore carelessly.
“He wouldn’t bother his head about a little
matter like this. The powers reserved to the states by
the constitution give a governor plenty of work without
acting as policeman of the jungle. That’s the reason I
said to Governor Dangerfield, ‘Governor,’ I said, ‘don’t
worry about this Appleweight business. Time is heavy
on my hands,’ I said. ‘You stay in Raleigh and uphold
the dignity of your office, and I will take care of the
trouble in Dilwell.’ And you can’t understand, Cooke,
how his face brightened at my words. Being the brave
man he is, you would naturally expect him to come
down here in person and seize these scoundrels with his
own hands. I had the hardest time of my life to get
him to stay at home. It almost broke his heart not to
come.”</p>

<p>And as they retraced their steps to the caboose, it was
Ardmore who led, stepping briskly along, and blithely
swinging the jug.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />


<small>PROFESSOR GRISWOLD TAKES THE FIELD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span> and Griswold stopped at the telegraph office
on their way back to the executive mansion, and were
met with news that the sheriff of Mingo had refused to
receive Griswold’s message.</p>

<p>“His private lines of communication with the capital
are doubtless well established,” said Griswold, “and
Bosworth probably warned him, but it isn’t of great
importance. It’s just as well for Appleweight and his
friends, high and low, to show their hands.”</p>

<p>When they were again on the veranda, Griswold lingered
for a moment with no valid excuse for delay beyond
the loveliness of the night and his keen delight in Barbara’s
voice and her occasional low laughter, which was
so pleasant to hear that he held their talk to a light
key, that he might evoke it the more. Professor Griswold’s
last flirtation was now so remote that he would
have been hard put to say whether the long-departed
goddess’s name had been Evelyn or Laura. He had so
thoroughly surrendered himself to the exactions of the
law that love and marriage held small place in his
speculations of the future. He had heard himself called
a bachelor professor with the humorous tolerance of one
who is pretty sure of himself, and who is not yet reduced
to the cynical experiment of peering beneath the top
layer of his box of strawberries to find the false bottom.
He recalled the slender manuscript volume of verses in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
his desk at home, and he felt that it would be the easiest
thing in the world to write a thousand songs to-night,
beside which the soundest brief ever filed in any court
would be the silliest of literary twaddle.</p>

<p>“You have done all that could be asked of you, Mr.
Griswold, and I cannot permit you to remain longer.
Father will certainly be here to-morrow. I assure you
that it is not like him to avoid his public obligations.
His absence is the most unaccountable thing that ever
happened. I have my difficulties here at home, for since
my mother’s death I have had the care of my young
sisters, and it is not pleasant to have to deceive them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but your father isn’t absent! He is officially
present and in the saddle,” laughed Griswold. “You
must not admit, even to me, that he is not here in full
charge of his office. And as for my leaving the field, I
have not the slightest intention of going back to Virginia
until the Appleweight ghost is laid, the governor of
North Carolina brought to confusion, and the governor
of South Carolina visibly present and thundering his
edicts again, so to speak, <i>ex cathedra</i>. My own affairs
can wait, Miss Osborne. My university may go hang,
my clients may be mulcted in direst damages, but just
now I am your humble servant, and I shall not leave
your service until my tasks are finished. I am consulting
not my duty, but my pleasure. The joy of
having a hand in a little affair like this, and of being
able to tell my friend Tommy Ardmore about it afterward,
would be sufficient. Ardmore will never speak to
me again for not inviting him to a share in the game.”</p>

<p>He was more buoyant than she had seen him, and she
liked the note of affection that crept into his tone as he
spoke of his friend.</p>

<p>“Ardmore is the most remarkable person alive,” Griswold
continued. “You remember—I spoke of him this
morning. He likes to play the inscrutable idiot, and he
carries it off pretty well; but underneath he’s really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
clever. The most amazing ideas take hold of him. You
never could imagine what he’s doing now! I met him
accidentally in Atlanta the other day, and he was in
pursuit of a face—a girl’s face that he had seen from a
car window for only an instant on a siding somewhere.”</p>

<p>“He must have a romantic temperament,” suggested
Barbara.</p>

<p>“Quite that. His family have been trying to marry
him off to some one in their own set ever since I have
known him, but he’s extremely difficult. One of the
most remarkable things about him is his amazing democracy.
He owns a palace on Fifth Avenue, but rarely
occupies it, for he says it bores him. He has a camp in
the Adirondacks, but I have never known him to visit
it. His place in North Carolina pleases him because
there he commands space, and no one can crowd him or
introduce him to people he doesn’t want to meet. He
declares that the most interesting people don’t have more
than a dollar a day to spend; that the most intelligent
and the best-looking girls in America clerk in shops and
work in factories. A philanthropic lady in New York
supplies him every Christmas with a list of names of
laundry girls, who seem to appeal particularly to Ardy’s
compassion, though he never knew one in his life, but
he admires them for the zeal with which they destroy
buttonholes and develop the deckle-edge cuff; and he
has twenty-dollar bills mailed to them quite mysteriously,
and without any hint of who Santa Claus really is.”</p>

<p>“But the girl he saw from the car window—did she
also appeal to him altruistically?”</p>

<p>“No; it was with her eye. He declared to me most
solemnly that the girl winked at him!”</p>

<p>Griswold was aware that Miss Osborne’s interest in
Ardmore cooled perceptibly.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said, with that delightful intonation with
which a woman utterly extinguishes a sister.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have told you that,” said Griswold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
guiltily aware of falling temperature. “He is capable of
following a winking eye at a perfectly respectful distance
for a hundred years, and of being entertained all the
time by the joy of pursuit.”</p>

<p>“It seems very unusual,” said Barbara, with cold
finality.</p>

<p>Griswold remembered this talk as, the next day
aboard the train bound for Turner Court House, the
seat of Mingo County, South Carolina, he pondered a
telegram he had received from Ardmore. He read and
re-read this message, chewing cigars and scowling at
the landscape, and the cause of his perturbation of spirit
may be roughly summarized in these words:</p>

<p>On leaving the executive mansion the night before, he
had studied maps in his room at the Saluda House, and
carefully planned his campaign. He had talked by telephone
with the prosecuting attorney of Mingo County,
and found that official politely responsive. So much had
gone well. Then the juxtaposition of Ardmore’s estate
to the border, and the possible use of the house as headquarters,
struck in upon him. He would, after all, generously
take Ardmore into the game, and they would uphold
the honour and dignity of the great commonwealth
of South Carolina together. The keys of all Ardmore’s
houses were, so to speak, in Griswold’s pocket, and invitations
were unnecessary between them; yet at Atlanta
Ardmore had made a point of asking Griswold down to
help while away the tedium of Mrs. Atchison’s house
party, and as a matter of form Griswold had wired from
Columbia, advising Ardmore of his unexpected descent.</p>

<p>Even in case Ardmore should still be abroad in pursuit
of the winking eye, the doors of the huge house
would be open to Griswold, who had entered there so
often as the owner’s familiar friend. These things he
pondered deeply as he read and re-read Ardmore’s reply
to his message, a reply which was plainly enough dated
at Ardsley, but which, he could not know, had really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
been written in caboose 0186 as it lay on a siding in
the south-eastern yards at Raleigh, and thence despatched
to the manager at Ardsley, with instructions to forward
it as a new message to Griswold at Columbia. The chilling
words thus flung at him were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Professor Henry Maine Griswold,<br />
<span class="indentleft4">Saluda House, Columbia, S. C.:</span></p>

<p>I am very sorry, old man, but I cannot take you in just now. Scarlet
fever is epidemic among my tenants, and I could not think of exposing
you to danger. As soon as the accursed plague passes I want to have
you down.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ardmore.</span></p>
</div>

<p>An epidemic that closed the gates of Ardsley would
assume the proportions of a national disaster; for even
if the great house itself were quarantined, there were
lodges and bungalows scattered over the domain, where
a host of guests could be entertained in comfort. Griswold
reflected that the very fact that he had wired from
Columbia must have intimated to Ardmore that his
friend was flying toward him, pursuant to the Atlanta
invitation. Griswold dismissed a thousand speculations
as unworthy. Ardmore had never shown the remotest
trace of snobbishness, and as far as the threatened house
party was concerned, Griswold knew Mrs. Atchison very
well, and had been entertained at her New York house.</p>

<p>The patronizing tone of the thing caused Griswold to
flush at every reading. If the Ardsley date-line had not
been so plainly written, if the phraseology were not so
characteristic, there might be room for doubt; but Ardmore—Ardmore
of all men—had slapped him in the
face!</p>

<p>But scarlet fever or no scarlet fever, the pursuit of
Appleweight had precedence of private grievances. By
the time he reached Turner Court House Griswold had
dismissed the ungraciousness of Ardmore, and his jaws
were set with a determination to perform the mission
intrusted to him by Barbara Osborne, and to wait until
later for an accounting with his unaccountable friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>Arrived at Turner’s, Griswold strode at once toward
the court house. The contemptuous rejection of his
message by the sheriff of Mingo had angered Griswold,
but he was destined to feel even more poignant insolence
when, entering the sheriff’s office, a deputy, languidly
posed as a letter “V” in a swivel-chair, with his feet
on the mantel, took a cob pipe from his mouth and
lazily answered Griswold’s importunate query with:</p>

<p>“The sheriff ain’t hyeh, seh. He’s a-visitin’ his folks
in Tennessy.”</p>

<p>“When will he be back?” demanded Griswold, hot of
heart, but maintaining the icy tone that had made him
so formidable in cross-examination.</p>

<p>“I reckon I don’t know, seh.”</p>

<p>“Do you know your own name?” persisted Griswold
sweetly.</p>

<p>“Go to hell, seh,” replied the deputy. He reached for
a match, relighted his pipe, and carefully crossed his
feet on the mantelshelf. The moment Griswold’s steps
died away in the outer corridor the deputy rose and
busied himself so industriously with the telephone that
within an hour all through the Mingo hills, and even
beyond the state line, along lonely trails, across hills and
through valleys, and beside cheery creeks and brooks,
it was known that a strange man from Columbia was in
Mingo County looking for the sheriff, and Appleweight,
<i>alias</i> Poteet, and his men were everywhere on guard.</p>

<p>Griswold liked the prosecuting attorney on sight. His
name was Habersham, and he was a youngster with a
clear and steady gray eye. Instead of the Southern
statesman’s flowing prince albert, he wore a sack-coat of
gray jeans, and was otherwise distinguished by a shirt
of white-and-blue check. He grinned as Griswold bent
a puzzled look upon him.</p>

<p>“I took your courses at the university two years ago,
Professor, and I remember distinctly that you always
wore a red cravat to your Wednesday lectures.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“You have done well,” replied Griswold, “for I never
expected to find an old student who remembered half as
much of me as that. Now, as I understood you over
the telephone, Appleweight was indicted for stealing a
ham in this county by the last grand jury, but the sheriff
has failed or refused to make the arrest. How did the
grand jury come to indict if this outlaw dominates all
the hill country?”</p>

<p>“The grand jury wanted to make a showing of virtue,
and it was, of course, understood between the foreman,
the leader of the gang, and the sheriff that no warrant
could be served on Appleweight. I did my duty; the
grand jury’s act was exemplary; and there the wheels
of justice are blocked. The same thing is practically
true across the state line in Dilwell County, North Carolina.
These men, led by Appleweight, use their intimate
knowledge of the country to elude pursuers when at
times the revenue men undertake a raid, and the county
authorities have never seriously molested them. Now
and then one of these sheriffs will make a feint of going
out to look for Appleweight, but you may be sure that
due notice is given before he starts. Three revenue
officers have lately been killed while looking for these
men, and the government is likely to take vigorous
action before long.”</p>

<p>“We may as well be frank,” said Griswold in his most
professional voice. “I don’t want the federal authorities
to take these men; it is important that they should
not do so. This is an affair between the governors of
the two Carolinas. It has been said that neither of
them dares press the matter of arrest, but I am here
in Governor Osborne’s behalf to give the lie to that
imputation.”</p>

<p>“That has undoubtedly been the fact, as you know,”
and Habersham smiled at his old preceptor inquiringly.
“Osborne once represented the Appleweights, and he
undoubtedly saved the leader from the gallows. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
was before Osborne ever thought of becoming governor,
and he acted only within his proper rights as a lawyer.
I don’t recall that anything in professional ethics requires
us to abandon a client because we know he’s
guilty. If such were the case we’d all starve to death.”</p>

<p>“Governor Osborne has been viciously maligned,” declared
Griswold. “While he did at one time represent
these people—no doubt thoroughly and efficiently—he
holds the loftiest ideal of public service, and it was only
when his official integrity was brought into question by
unscrupulous enemies that he employed me as special
counsel to carry this affair through to a conclusion.
That accounts for my presence here, Habersham, and,
with your assistance, I propose to force Governor Dangerfield’s
hand. Suppose all these people were arrested in
Mingo County under these indictments, what would be
the result—trial and acquittal?”</p>

<p>“Just that, in spite of any effort made to convict
them.”</p>

<p>“Well, Governor Osborne is tired of this business, and
wants the Appleweight scandal disposed of once and
for all.”</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” remarked Habersham, clearly surprised
at Griswold’s vigorous tone. “I called on the
governor in his office at Columbia only ten days ago,
and he put me off. He said he had to prepare an address
to deliver before the South Carolina Political Reform
Association, and he couldn’t take up the Appleweight
case; and I called on Bosworth, the attorney-general,
and he grew furiously angry, and said I was guilty of the
gravest malfeasance in not having brought those men
to book long ago. When I suggested that he connive
with the governor towards removing our sheriff, he declared
that the governor was a coward. He seemed
anxious to put the governor in a hole, though why he
should take that attitude I can’t make out, as it has
been generally understood that Governor Osborne’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
personal friendliness for him secured his nomination and
election to the attorney-generalship, and I have heard
that he is engaged to the governor’s oldest daughter.”</p>

<p>“He is a contemptible hound,” replied Griswold with
feeling, “and at the proper time we shall deal with him;
but it is of more importance just now to make Appleweight
a prisoner in North Carolina. If he’s arrested
over there, that lets us out; and if the North Carolina
authorities won’t arrest their own criminals, we’ll go
over into Dilwell County and show them how to be good.
The man’s got to be locked up, and he’d look much
better in a North Carolina jail, under all the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“That’s good in theory, but how do you justify it in
law?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the merest matter of formulæ! My dear
Habersham, all the usual processes of law go down before
emergencies!”</p>

<p>The airiness of Griswold’s tone caused the prosecutor
to laugh, for this was not the sober associate professor
of admiralty whose lectures he had sat under at the
University of Virginia, but a different person, whose
new attitude toward the law and its enforcement shocked
him immeasurably.</p>

<p>“You seem to be going in for pretty loose interpretations,
and if that plaster bust of John Marshall up there
falls from the shelf, you need not be surprised,” and
Habersham still laughed. “I might be impudent and
cite you against yourself!”</p>

<p>“That would constitute contempt of court, and I cannot
just now spare your services long enough for you to
serve a jail sentence. Go on now, and tell me what you
have done and what you propose.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I told you over the telephone, we hear a
great deal about Appleweight and his crowd; but we
never hear much of their enemies, who are, nevertheless,
of the same general stock, and equally determined when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
aroused. Ten of these men I have quietly called to meet
at my farm out here a few miles from town, on Thursday
night. They come from different points over the
country, and we’ll have a small but grim posse that
will be ready for business. You may not know it, but
the Appleweights are most religious. Appleweight himself
boasts that he never misses church on Sunday. He
goes also to the mid-week service on Thursday night,
so I have learned, and thereby hangs our opportunity.
Mount Nebo Church lies off here toward the north.
It’s a lonely point in itself, though it’s the spiritual
centre and rendezvous for a wide area. If Appleweight
can be taken at all, that’s the place, and I’m willing
to make the trial. Whether to stampede the church
and make a fight, or seize him alone as he approaches
the place, is a question for discussion with the boys I
have engaged to go into the game. How does it strike
you?”</p>

<p>“First-rate. Ten good men ought to be enough; but
if it comes down to numbers, the state militia can be
brought into use. The South Carolina National Guard
is in camp, and we can have a regiment quick enough,
if I ask it.”</p>

<p>Habersham whistled.</p>

<p>“Osborne is certainly up and doing!” he exclaimed,
chuckling. “I suppose he has tossed a quarter, and
decided it’s better to be good than to be senator. By
the way, that was a curious story in the newspapers
about Dangerfield and Osborne having a row at New
Orleans. I wonder just what passed between them?”</p>

<p>Griswold was conscious that Habersham glanced at
him a little curiously, with a look that implied something
that half formed itself on the prosecuting attorney’s
lips.</p>

<p>“I know nothing beyond what I read in the newspapers
at the time. Some political row, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Governor Osborne hasn’t discussed it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
you since his return to Columbia?” asked Habersham
carelessly. The shadow of a smile flitted across his face,
but vanished quickly as though before a returning consciousness
of the fact that he was facing Henry Maine
Griswold, who was first of all a gentleman, and not less
a scholar and a man of the world, who was not to be
trifled with.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Griswold, a little shortly. “I was appealed
to in rather an unusual way in this matter of
Appleweight. It is quite out of my line as a legal
proposition, but there are other considerations of which
I may not speak.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” murmured Habersham; but he asked:
“What was Governor Osborne doing when you left
Columbia?”</p>

<p>“When I left Columbia,” remarked Griswold, and it
was he that smiled now, “to the best of my knowledge
and belief the governor of South Carolina was deeply
absorbed in knitting a necktie, the colour of which was,
I think, the orange of a Blue Ridge autumn sunset.
And now, if you will kindly give me pen and paper, I
will communicate the Appleweight situation and our
prospects to my honoured chief.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />


<small>TWO LADIES ON A BALCONY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> outer aspect of Ardsley is, frankly, feudal. The
idea of a North Carolina estate had grown out of Ardmore’s
love of privacy and his wish to get away from
New York, where his family was all too frequently struck
by the spot light. The great tract of land once secured
he had not concerned himself about a house, but had
thrown together a comfortable bungalow which satisfied
him for a year. But Ardmore’s gentle heart, inaccessible
to demands of many sorts, was a defenceless citadel
when appeals were made to his generosity. A poor
young architect, lately home from the Ecole des Beaux
Arts, with many honours but few friends, fell under
Ardmore’s eyes. The towers and battlements that soon
thereafter crowned the terraced slopes at Ardsley, etching
a noble line against the lovely panorama of North
Carolina hills, testified at once to the architect’s talent
for adaptation and Ardmore’s diminished balances at
the Bronx Loan and Trust Company.</p>

<p>On a balcony that commanded the sunset—a balcony
bright with geraniums that hung daringly over a ravine
on the west—Mrs. Atchison and Miss Jerry Dangerfield
were cosily taking their tea. Their white gowns, the
snowy awning stirring slightly in the hill air, the bright
trifles of the tea-table mingled in a picture of charm and
contentment.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Mrs. Atchison abruptly, “where
Tommy is.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“I have no definite idea,” said Jerry, pouring cream,
“but let us hope that he is earning his salary.”</p>

<p>“His salary?” and Mrs. Atchison’s brows contracted.
“Do you mean that my brother is taking pay for this
mysterious work he is doing?”</p>

<p>“He shall be paid in money,” replied Jerry with decision.
“As I have only the barest acquaintance with
Mr. Ardmore, never, in fact, having seen him until a
few days ago, it would be very improper for me to
permit him to serve me except under the rules that govern
the relations of employer and employee.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Atchison smiled with the wise tolerance of a
woman of the world; and she was a lady, it must be
said, who had a keen perception of that sane and ample
philosophy of life which proceeds, we may say, for the
sake of convenience, from the sense of humour. She did
not like to be puzzled; and she had never in her life
been surprised, least of all by any word or deed of her
singular brother Tommy. She liked and even cultivated
with daring the inadvertent turns in a day’s affairs.
The cool fashion in which her brother had placed the
daughter of the governor of North Carolina in her hands
on board her car at Raleigh had amused her. She had
learned nothing from Jerry of the beginnings of that
young woman’s acquaintance with the master of Ardsley—an
acquaintance which seemed to be intimate in certain
aspects but amazingly distant and opaque in others.
Miss Geraldine Dangerfield, like Mrs. Atchison herself,
was difficult to surprise, and Tommy Ardmore’s sister
admired this in any one, and she particularly admired
it in Jerry, who was so charming in so many other ways.
Mrs. Atchison imagined that Jerry’s social experience
had been meagre, and yet the girl accepted the conditions
of life at Ardsley as a matter of course, and in the
gatherings of the house party Jerry—there was no denying
it—held the centre of the stage.</p>

<p>The men, including the Duke of Ballywinkle, hung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
upon her lightest word, which often left them staggering;
and she frequently flung the ball of conversation
into the blue ether with a careless ease that kept expectancy
a-tiptoe in the minds and hearts of all the
company.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Mrs. Atchison, putting down her cup
and gazing dreamily into the west, “that you have not
given Tommy any commission in which he is likely to
fail. If it were a matter of finding a fan you had left
behind somewhere, or even of producing an extinct
flower from the Andes, he would undoubtedly be faithful
to the trust imposed on him; but in anything that is
really serious, really of importance, one should never
depend on Tommy.”</p>

<p>This was, as the lady knew, almost vulgarly leading;
but Jerry folded her arms, and spoke out with charming
frankness.</p>

<p>“I have heard my father say,” said Jerry, “that incapable
men often rise to great opportunities when they
are pushed. Mr. Ardmore has undertaken to perform
for me a service of the greatest delicacy and not unattended
with danger. You have been kind to me, Mrs.
Atchison, and as you are my chaperon and entitled to
my fullest confidence, it is right for you to know just
how I came here, and why your brother is absent in
my service.”</p>

<p>For once curiosity bound Mrs. Atchison in chains of
steel.</p>

<p>“Tell me nothing, dear, unless you are quite free to
do so,” she murmured; but her heart skipped a beat as
she waited.</p>

<p>“I should not think of doing so except of my own
free will,” declared Jerry, carelessly following the flight
of a hawk that flapped close by toward the neighbouring
woods. “It may interest you to know that just now
your brother, Mr. Thomas Ardmore, is the governor of
North Carolina. He does not exactly know it, for at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Raleigh I myself was governor of North Carolina at the
time we met, and I only made Mr. Ardmore my private
secretary; but when it became necessary to take the
field I placed him in full charge, and he is now not only
governor of the Old North State, but also the commander-in-chief
of her troops in the field.”</p>

<p>With a nice feeling for climax Jerry paused, picked
a lump of sugar from the silver bowl on the tea-table,
bit the edge of it daintily, and tossed it to the robins
that hopped on the lawn beneath.</p>

<p>Mrs. Atchison moved forward slightly, but evinced no
other sign of surprise. The hour, the scene, the girl
were all to her liking. She would even prolong the
delight of hearing the further history of her brother’s
amazing elevation to supreme power in an American
commonwealth—it was so foreign to all experience, so
heavy with possibilities, so delicious in that it had
happened to Tommy of all men in the world!</p>

<p>“I trust,” she said, smiling a little, “that Tommy will
not prove unworthy of the confidence you have reposed
in him.”</p>

<p>“If he does,” said Jerry, slapping her hands together
to free them of an imaginary sugar crumb, “I shall
never, never marry him.”</p>

<p>“Then may I ask, Miss Dangerfield, if you and he
are engaged?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Mrs. Atchison! Not only are we not engaged,
but he has never even proposed to me. Besides,
I am engaged to Colonel Rutherford Gillingwater, our
adjutant-general.”</p>

<p>“Then if you are engaged to this military person, just
wherein lies the significance of your threat never to
marry my brother.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Jerry, “is perfectly easy of explanation.
Your brother and I have met only a few times, and I
never become engaged to any man whom I have not
known for a week at least. Marriage is a serious matter;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
and while the frequent breaking of engagements is
painful in the extreme, I think one cannot be too careful
in assuming the marriage bond.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Atchison wondered whether the girl was amusing
herself at her expense, but Jerry’s tone was grave and
Jerry’s eyes were steady. Jerry was a new species, and
she had appeared at a fortunate moment when Mrs.
Atchison had almost concluded that the world is a
squeezed lemon.</p>

<p>“In view of the fact that you are engaged to Dillingwater——”
began Mrs. Atchison, anxious for further disclosures
touching Jerry’s ideas on matrimony.</p>

<p>“Colonel Rutherford Gillingwater, please!” corrected
Jerry.</p>

<p>“—I don’t quite grasp this matter of your attitude
toward my brother. Unless I misunderstood you, you
remarked a moment ago that unless he succeeded in his
present undertaking you would never marry him.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I said, and I meant every word
of it,” declared Jerry. “I will not conceal from you,
Mrs. Atchison, my determination that your brother shall
be my second husband.”</p>

<p>There was no question of Mrs. Atchison’s complete
surprise now.</p>

<p>“Your <i>second</i> husband, child?”</p>

<p>“My second husband, Mrs. Atchison. Life is short at
best, and I was told by my old mammy when I was a
little child—she turned out afterward to be a real voodoo
woman—that I should be married twice. I am very
superstitious, and that made a great impression on my
mind. It is not in keeping with my ideas of life, Mrs.
Atchison, to be long a widow, so that I think it perfectly
right to choose a second husband even before I am quite
sure that I have chosen wisely for my first.”</p>

<p>“Has the military person weak lungs?”</p>

<p>“No; but his mind is not strong. Anything sudden,
like apoplexy, would be sure to go hard with him.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Then you should be careful not to shock him. It
would be almost criminal to break your engagement with
him.”</p>

<p>“That rests entirely with him, Mrs. Atchison. The
man I love must be brave, tender, and true. After our
present difficulties are over I shall know whether Rutherford
Gillingwater is the man I believe I am going to
marry in October.”</p>

<p>“But you spoke a moment ago of Tommy’s official
position. Is this arrangement a matter of general knowledge
in North Carolina?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not. You and he and I are the only persons
who know it. Papa does not know it yet; and
when papa finds it out it may go hard with him. You
see, Mrs. Atchison”—and Jerry leaned forward and
rested an elbow on the tea-table and tucked her little
chin into the palm of her hand—“you see, papa is very
absent-minded, as great men often are, and he went
away and forgot to perform some duties which the
honour and dignity of the state require to be performed
immediately. There are some wicked men who have
caused both North Carolina and South Carolina a great
deal of trouble, but they must not be punished in this
state, but in South Carolina, which is just over there
somewhere. There are many reasons for that which
would be very tiresome to tell you about, but the principal
one is that Barbara Osborne, the daughter of the
governor of South Carolina, is the snippiest and stuck-upest
person I have ever known, and while your brother
and I are in charge of this state I have every intention
of annoying her in every way I can. When Mr. Ardmore
has caught those wicked men I spoke of, who
really do not belong in this state at all, they will be
marched straight into South Carolina, and then we shall
see what Governor Osborne does about it; and we will
show Barbara Osborne, whose father never had to paper
<i>his</i> dining-room, after the war between the states, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
bonds of the Confederacy—we will show her that there’s
a good deal of difference between the Dangerfields and
the Osbornes, and between the proud Old North State
and the state of South Carolina.”</p>

<p>“And you have placed this business, requiring courage
and finesse, in Tommy’s hands?”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I have done, Mrs. Atchison.
Your brother is no great distance from here, and we
have exchanged telegrams to-day; but when I told you
a moment ago that I did not know his whereabouts
exactly I spoke the truth. Your brother’s appearance
on the scene at the beginning was most providential.
The stage was set, the curtain waited”—Jerry extended
her arms to indicate a breadth of situation—“but there
was no valiant hero. I needed a leading man, and Mr.
Ardmore walked in like a fairy prince ready to take the
part. And what I shall say to you further, as my
chaperon, will not, I hope, cause you to think ill of
me.”</p>

<p>“I love you more and more! You may tell me anything
you like without fear of being misunderstood;
but tell me nothing that you prefer to keep to yourself.”</p>

<p>“If you were not Mr. Ardmore’s sister I should not
tell you this; and I shall never tell another soul. I was
coming home from a visit in Baltimore, and the train
stopped somewhere to let another train pass. The two
trains stood side by side for a little while, and in the
window of the sleeper opposite me I saw a young man
who seemed very sad. I thought perhaps he had buried
all his friends, for he had the appearance of one lately
bereaved. It has always seemed to me that we should
do what we can to cheer the afflicted, and this gentleman
was staring out of his window very sadly, as though
he needed a friend, and as he caught my eye it seemed
to me that there was an appeal in it that it would have
been unwomanly for me to ignore. So, just as my train
started, at the very last moment that we looked at each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
other, I winked at that gentleman with, I think, my
right eye.”</p>

<p>Miss Geraldine Dangerfield touched the offending
member delicately with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Mrs. Atchison bent forward and took both the girl’s
hands.</p>

<p>“And that was Tommy—my brother Tommy!”</p>

<p>“That gentleman has proved to be Mr. Thomas Ardmore.
I had not the slightest idea that I should ever
in the world see him again. My only hope was that he
would go on his way cheered and refreshed by my sign
of good-will, though he was either so depressed or so
surprised that he made no response. I never expected
to see him again in this world; and when I had almost
forgotten all about him he coolly sent in his card to me
at the executive mansion in Raleigh. And I was very
harsh with him when I learned who he was; for you
know the Ardmore estate owns a lot of North Carolina
bonds that are due on the first of June, and Mr. Billings
had been chasing papa all over the country to know
whether they will be paid; and I supposed that of course
your brother was looking for papa too, to annoy him
about some mere detail of that bond business, for the
state treasurer, who does not love papa, has gone away
fishing, and Mr. Billings is perfectly wild.”</p>

<p>“Delicious!” exclaimed Mrs. Atchison. “Perfectly
delicious! And I am sure that when Tommy explained
his real sentiments toward Mr. Billings you and he
became friends at once.”</p>

<p>“Not at once, for I came very near having him thrown
out of the house; and I laughed at him about a jug that
was given to him on the train at Kildare with a message
in it for papa. You know when you are governor people
always give you presents—that is, your friendly constituents
do. The others give you only unkind words.
The temperance people send you jugs of buttermilk on
board your train as you pass through the commonwealth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
and others send you applejack. Your brother
gave back the buttermilk and kept the jug of applejack,
which had a warning to father in its corn-cob stopper.
I thought it was very funny, and I laughed at your
brother so that he was scared and ran out of the house.
Then afterwards I looked out of the window of papa’s
office, and saw Mr. Ardmore sitting on a bench in the
state-house yard looking ever so sad and dejected, and
I sent the private secretary out to get him; and now
we are, I think, the best of friends, and Mr. Ardmore
is, as I have already told you, the governor of North
Carolina to all intents and purposes.”</p>

<p>“May I call you Jerry? Thank you, dear. Let me
tell you that I am thirty-two, and you are——?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen,” supplied Jerry.</p>

<p>“And this is the most amusing, interesting, and exciting
thing I have heard in all my life. It might be
difficult ordinarily for me to forgive the wink, but your
explanation lifts it out of the realm of social impropriety
into the sphere of generous benevolence. And if,
after Colonel Gillingwater has gone to his reward, you
should marry my brother, I shall do all in my power
to make your life in our family happy in every way.”</p>

<p>“Your brother does not seem particularly proud of
his family connection,” said Jerry. “He spoke of you
in the most beautiful way, but he seems distressed by
the actions of some of the others.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Atchison sighed.</p>

<p>“Tommy is right about us. We are a sad lot.”</p>

<p>“But he is very hard on the duke. Since I came to
Ardsley his Grace has treated me with the greatest
courtesy, and he has spoken to me in the most complimentary
terms. He is beyond question a man of kind
heart, for he has promised me his mother’s pearl necklace,
which had been in her family for four hundred years.”</p>

<p>“I should not hesitate to take the necklace, Jerry, if
he really produces it, for my sister, his wife, has never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
had the slightest glimpse of it, and it is, I believe, in the
hands of certain English trustees for the benefit of the
duke’s creditors. I dislike to spoil one of his Grace’s
pretty illusions, but unless Mr. Billings softens his heart
a great deal toward the duke I fear that you will not
get the pearls this summer.”</p>

<p>“I must tell you as my chaperon, Mrs. Atchison, that
the duke has already offered to elope with me. He told
me last night, as we were having our coffee on the terrace,
that he would gladly give up his wife, meaning, I
suppose, your sister, and the Ardmore millions for me;
but while I think him fascinating, I want you to feel
quite safe, for I promise you I shall elope with no one
while I am your guest.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Atchison’s face had grown a little white, and she
compressed her lips in lines that were the least bit grim.</p>

<p>“The scoundrel!” she exclaimed half under her
breath. “To think that he would insult a child like
you! He is hanging about us here in the hope of getting
more money, while my poor sister, his wife, is in
an English sanatorium half crazed by his brutality. If
Tommy knew this he would undoubtedly kill him!”</p>

<p>“That would be very unnecessary. A duke, after all,
is something, and I should hate to have the poor man
killed on my account. And besides, Mrs. Atchison, I
am perfectly able to take care of myself.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are, Jerry. But it’s a terrible thing to
have that beast about, and I shall tell him to-night that
he must leave this place and the country.”</p>

<p>“But first,” said Jerry, “I have an engagement to
ride with him after dinner to see the moon, and the
opportunity of seeing a moon with a duke of ancient
family, here on the sacred soil of North Carolina, is
something that I cannot lightly put aside.”</p>

<p>“You cannot—you must not go!”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” said Jerry, smiling slightly; “and
I promise you that the duke will never again insult an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
American girl. And now I think I must dress for
dinner.”</p>

<p>She rose and turned her eyes dreamily to the tower
above, where the North Carolina state flag flapped idly
in the breeze. This silken emblem with its single star
Miss Geraldine Dangerfield carried with her in her trunk
wherever she travelled; and having noted Ardsley’s
unadorned flagstaff, she had, with her own hands, unfurled it,
highly resolved that it should remain until
the rightful governor returned to his own.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, as Mrs. Atchison was reading the
late mail in her sitting-room, she took up a New York
newspaper of the day before and ran over the headlines.
“Lost: A Governor” was a caption that held her eye,
and she read a special despatch dated Raleigh with
deepest interest. Governor Dangerfield, the item hinted,
had not yet returned from New Orleans, where he had
gone to attend the Cotton Planters’ Convention, and
where, moreover, he had quarrelled with the governor
of South Carolina. The cowardly conduct of both
governors in dealing with the Appleweight band of outlaws
was recited at length; and it was also intimated
that Governor Dangerfield was deliberately absenting
himself from his office to avoid meeting squarely the
Appleweight issue.</p>

<p>Mrs. Atchison smiled to herself; then she laughed
merrily as she rang for her maid.</p>

<p>“Little Jerry’s story seemed highly plausible as she
told it; and yet she is perfectly capable of spinning
romance with that pretty mouth of hers, particularly
when backed by those sweet and serious blue eyes.
Tommy and Jerry! The combination is irresistible!
If she has really turned the state of North Carolina
over to my little brother, something unusual will certainly
happen before long.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Atchison was quite right in her surmise, as
we shall see.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />


<small>THE EMBARRASSMENTS OF THE DUKE OF BALLYWINKLE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Frank Collins</span>, of the Atlanta <i>Palladium</i>, trod the
ties beyond Kildare with a light heart, gaily swinging
a suit-case. He had walked far, but a narrow-brim
straw hat, perched on the back of his head, and the
cheery lilt of the waltz he whistled, spoke for a jaunty
spirit. As his eye ranged the landscape he marked a
faint cloud of smoke rising beyond a lonely strip of
wood; and coming to a dilapidated piece of track that
led vaguely away into the heart of the forest, he again
noted the tiny smoke-cloud. On such a day the half-gods
go and the gods arrive; and the world that afternoon
knew no cheerfuller spirit than the <i>Palladium’s</i>
agile young commissioner. Mr. Collins was not only in
capital health and spirits, but he rejoiced in that delicious
titillation of expectancy which is the chief compensation
of the journalist’s life. His mission was
secret, and this in itself gave flavour to his errand;
and, moreover, it promised adventures of a kind that
were greatly to his liking.</p>

<p>As the woodland closed in about him and the curving
spur carried him farther from the main right of way,
he ceased whistling, and his steps became more guarded.
Suddenly a man rose from the bushes and levelled a
long arm at him detainingly.</p>

<p>“Stop, young man, stop where you are!”</p>

<p>“Hello!” called Collins, pausing. “Well, I’m jiggered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
if it ain’t old Cookie. I say, old man, is the untaxed
juice flowing in the forest primeval or what brings
you here?”</p>

<p>Cooke grinned as he recalled the reporter, whom he
remembered as a particularly irrepressible specimen of
his genus whom he had met while pursuing moonshiners
in Georgia. The two shook hands amiably midway of
the two streaks of rust.</p>

<p>“Young man, I think I told you once before that your
legs were altogether too active. I want you to light right
out of here—skip!”</p>

<p>“Not for a million dollars. Our meeting is highly
opportune, Cookie. It’s not for me to fly in the face of
Providence. I’m going to see what’s doing down here.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Cooke. “Take it all in and enjoy
yourself; but you’re my prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be all right! So long as I’m with you
I can’t lose out.”</p>

<p>“March!” called Cooke, dropping behind; and thus
the two came in a few minutes to the engine, the cars,
and the caboose. From the locomotive a slight smoke
still trailed hazily upward.</p>

<p>Thomas Ardmore, coatless and hatless, sat on the
caboose steps writing messages on a broad pad, while
a telegraph instrument clicked busily within. One of
his men had qualified as operator, and a pile of messages
at his elbow testified to Ardmore’s industry. Ardmore
clutched in his left hand a message recently caught
from the wire, which he re-read from time to time with
increasing satisfaction. It had been sent from Ardsley
and ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I shall ride to-night on the road that leads south beyond the red
bungalow, and on the bridle-path that climbs the ridge on the west,
called Sunset Trail. A certain English gentleman will accompany me.
It will be perfectly agreeable to me to come back alone.</p>

<p class="right">G. D.</p>
</div>

<p>Ardmore was still writing when Cooke stood beneath
him under the caboose platform.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Ardmore, but this is our first
prisoner.”</p>

<p>Ardmore signed a despatch, and then looked up and
took the pipe from his mouth. Collins lifted his hat
politely.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Ardmore, you see I have taken advantage
of your exceedingly kind invitation to look you up in
North Carolina.”</p>

<p>“He was looking for you very hard when I found him,
Mr. Ardmore,” interposed Cooke.</p>

<p>“Your appearance delights me,” said Ardmore, extending
his hand to the reporter. “It was nice of you
to walk out here to find me. Wouldn’t they put you up
at the house?”</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is I didn’t stop there. My paper sent
me in this general direction on business, but I had every
honourable intention of making you that visit after I
finished my assignment. But Cookie here says I’m
arrested.”</p>

<p>“He’s a dangerous character and can’t be allowed to
run loose in these parts. I’m going to tie him up,”
said Cooke.</p>

<p>“May I ask you, Mr. Collins, just what you are doing
here?” inquired Ardmore.</p>

<p>“You may, and I’ll bet a boiled goose that Cooke
and I are on the same job.”</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?” demanded Ardmore’s
chief of staff.</p>

<p>“It’s a big story if I get it, and I have every intention
of getting it,” said Collins guardedly.</p>

<p>“Out with it!” commanded Ardmore.</p>

<p>“The fact is, then, that I’m looking for a person of
importance.”</p>

<p>“Go right on, please.”</p>

<p>“And that person is the governor of North Carolina,
who is mysteriously absent from Raleigh. He attended
the Cotton Planters’ Convention in New Orleans. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
got as far as Atlanta on his way home, and then disappeared.
I need not say to gentlemen of your intelligence
that a lost governor is ripe fruit in my business,
and I have reason to believe that for some purpose of
his own the governor of North Carolina is hiding in this
very neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>Cooke glanced at Ardmore for instructions, but the
master of Ardsley preferred to keep the matter in his
own hands.</p>

<p>“So you want to find the governor of North Carolina,
do you? Well, you shall not be disappointed. You are
too able and zealous to be wasted on journalism. I
have a feeling that you are destined to higher things.
Something told me when we met in Atlanta that fate
had set us apart for each other. That was why I asked
you to visit me when I really didn’t know but that, after
learning where the spoons are kept, you would skip
without leaving your subsequent address. But now
there is important business on hand, and the state of
North Carolina will take the liberty of borrowing you
from Georgia until the peace of the Old North State is
restored. And now, Collins, I will make a disclosure
that will undoubtedly startle you a good deal, but you
are no longer employed by the Atlanta <i>Palladium</i>, and
your obligations to that journal must be transferred to
the state in which you now stand. You came here,
Collins, to look for the governor of North Carolina, and
your wits and your argus-nose for news have served
you well. You have found the governor of North Carolina:
<i>I</i> am he!”</p>

<p>Collins had stood during this recital in the middle of
the track, with his legs wide apart, calmly fanning himself
with his hat; but as Ardmore proceeded the reporter’s
hand dropped to his side, and a grin that had
overspread his face slowly yielded to a blank stare.</p>

<p>“Would you mind repeating those last words?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> am the governor of North Carolina, Mr. Collins.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
The manner in which I attained that high office is not
important. It must suffice that I am in sole charge of
the affairs of this great state, without relief from valuation
or appraisement laws and without benefit of clergy.
And we have much to do here; mere social conversation
must await an ampler time. I now appoint you publicity
agent to the governor. Your business is to keep
the people fooled—all the people all the time. In other
words, you are chief liar to the administration, a position
of vast responsibility, for which you have, if I am
a judge of character, the greatest talents. You will
begin by sending out word that Governor Dangerfield
has given up all other work at present but the destruction
of the Appleweight gang. These stories that the
governor has hidden himself to dodge certain duties are
all punk—do you understand?—he is serving the people
as he has always served them, faithfully and with the
noblest self-sacrifice. That’s the sort of stuff I want
you to jam into the newspapers all over the world. And
remember—my name does not appear in the business at
all—neither now nor hereafter.”</p>

<p>“But by the ghost of John C. Calhoun, don’t you see
that I’m losing the chance of my life in my own profession?
There’s a story in this that would put me to
the top and carry me right into New York,” and Collins
glanced about for his suit-case, as though meditating
flight.</p>

<p>“Your appointment has gone into effect,” said Ardmore
with finality, “and if you bolt you will be caught
and made to walk the plank. And so far as your future
is concerned, you shall have a newspaper of your own
anywhere you please as soon as this war is over.”</p>

<p>The three men adjourned to the caboose where Ardmore
told Collins all that it seemed necessary for the
newspaper man to know; and within half an hour the
new recruit had entered thoroughly into the spirit of
the adventure, though his mirth occasionally got the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
better of him, and he bowed his head in his hands and
surrendered himself to laughter. Thereafter, until the
six o’clock supper was ready, he kept the operator occupied.
He sent to the <i>Palladium</i> a thoroughly plausible
story, giving prominence to the Appleweight case and
laying stress on Governor Dangerfield’s vigorous personality
and high sense of official responsibility. He
sent queries to leading journals everywhere, offering
exclusive news of the rumoured disappearance of North
Carolina’s governor. His campaign of publicity for the
state administration was broadly planned, though he
was losing a great opportunity to beat the world with a
stunning story of the amazing nerve with which Ardmore,
the young millionaire, had assumed the duties of
governor of North Carolina in the unaccountable absence
of Governor Dangerfield from his capital. The whole
thing was almost too good to be true, and Collins put
away the idea of flight only upon realizing the joyous
possibilities of sharing, no matter how humbly, in the
fate of an administration which was fashioning the
drollest of card-houses. He did not know, and was
not to know until long afterwards, just how the young
master of Ardsley had leaped into the breach; but Ardmore
was an extraordinary person, whose whims set
him quite apart from other men, and while, even if he
escaped being shot, the present enterprise would undoubtedly
lead to a long term in jail, Collins had committed
himself to Ardmore’s cause and would be faithful
to it, no matter what happened.</p>

<p>Ardmore took Collins more fully into his confidence
during the lingering twilight, and the reporter made
many suggestions that were of real value. Meanwhile
Cooke’s men brought three horses from the depths of
the forest, and saddled them. Cooke entered the caboose
for a final conference with Ardmore and a last look at
the maps.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” remarked the acting governor, “that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
must wait until to-morrow night to pick up the Appleweights,
but our present business is more important.
It’s time to move, Cooke.”</p>

<p>They rode off in single file on the faintest of trails
through the woods, Cooke leading and Ardmore and
Collins following immediately behind him. The great
host of summer stars thronged the sky, and the moon
sent its soft effulgence across the night. They presently
forded a noisy stream, and while they were seeking the
trail again on the farther side an owl hooted a thousand
yards up the creek, and while the line re-formed Cooke
paused and listened. Then the owl’s call was repeated
farther off, and so faintly that Cooke alone heard it.
He laid his hand on Ardmore’s rein:</p>

<p>“There’s a foot-trail that leads along that creek, and
it’s very rough and difficult to follow. Half a mile from
here there used to be a still, run by one of the Appleweights.
We smashed it once, but no doubt they are
operating again by this time. That hoot of the owl is a
warning common among the pickets put out by these
people. Wireless telegraphy isn’t in it with them. Every
Appleweight within twenty miles will know in half an
hour how many there are of us and just what direction
we are taking. We must not come back here to-night.
We must put up on your place somewhere and let them
think, if they will, we are guests of yours out for an
evening ride.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Unless we complete this job in
about two days my administration is a fizzle,” said Ardmore,
as they resumed their march through the forest.
There was a wilder fling to the roll of the land now, but
the underbrush was better cleared, and the trail had
become a bridle-path that had known man’s care.</p>

<p>“This is some of Paul’s work,” said Ardmore; “and
if I am not very much mistaken we are on my land now
and headed straight enough for the wagon-road that
leads south beyond the red bungalow. These roads in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
here were planned to give variety, but I never before
appreciated how complicated they are.”</p>

<p>The path stretched away through the heavy forest,
and they climbed to a ridge that commanded a wide
region that lay bathed in silver moonlight, so softly
luminous that it seemed of the stuff of shadows made
light. Westward, a mile distant, lay Ardsley, only a
little below the level of the ridge and touched with a
faint purple as of spring twilight.</p>

<p>Ardmore sat his saddle, quietly contemplating the
great house that struck him almost for the first time
as imposing. He felt, too, a little heartache that he
did not quite understand. He was not sure whether
it was the effect of the moon, or whether he was tired,
or what it was, though he thought perhaps the moon
had something to do with it. His own house, of which
he was sincerely fond, seemed mistily hung between
heaven and earth in the moonlight, a thing not wholly
of this world; and in his depression of spirit he reflected
for a moment on his own aimless, friendless life; he
knew then that he was lonely, and that there was a great
void in his mind and heart and soul, and he knew also
that Jerry Dangerfield and not the moon was the cause
of his melancholy.</p>

<p>“We’d better be moving,” suggested Cooke.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad to leave that picture,” remarked Collins,
sighing. “Had I the lyre of Gray I should compose an
‘Ode on a Distant Prospect of Ardsley Castle,’ which
would ultimately reach the school readers and bring me
fame more enduring than brass.”</p>

<p>“Did you say brass?” ironically scoffed Cooke.</p>

<p>Whereupon the <i>Palladium’s</i> late representative laughed
softly and muttered to himself,</p>

<p class="center">“Proud pile, by mighty Ardmore’s hand upreared!”</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” commanded Cooke, “or I’ll drop you
into the ravine. Look below there!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Looking off from the ridge they saw a man and a
woman riding along a strip of road from which the
timber had been cut. The night was so still, the gray
light so subdued, that the two figures moved as steadily
and softly as shadow pictures on a screen.</p>

<p>The slow, even movement of the riders was interrupted
suddenly. The man, who was nearer the remote observers,
had stopped and bent towards the woman as
though to snatch her rein, when her horse threw up its
head and fell back on its haunches. Then the woman
struck the man a blow with her riding-crop, and galloped
swiftly away along the white, ribbon-like road. In the
perfect night-silence it was like a scene of pantomime.</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” cried Cooke. “Come along!
We’ll cut into that road at the bungalow.”</p>

<p>They swung their horses away from the ridge and
back into the bridle-path, which once more dipped
sharply down into heavy timber, Cooke leading the
way, and three of the best hunters known to the Ardsley
stables flew down the clear but winding path. The incident
which the trio had witnessed required no interpretation:
the girl’s blow and flight had translated it
into language explicit enough.</p>

<p>Ardmore thanked his German forester a thousand
times for the admirable bridle-path over which they
galloped, with its certain footing beneath and clean
sweep from the boughs above. The blood surged hotly
through his heart, and he was angry for the first time in
his life; but his head was cool, and the damp air of the
forest flowing by tranquillized him into a new elation
of spirit. Jerry Dangerfield was the dearest and noblest
and bravest girl in the world—he knew that: and she
was clever and resourceful enough to devise means for
preserving her father’s official and private honour; and
not less quick to defend herself from insult from a titled
scoundrel. She was the most inexplicable of girls; but
at the same time she was beyond any question the wisest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
The thought that he should now see her soon, after all
the years that had passed since he had introduced her
to his sister at Raleigh, filled him with wild delight, and
he prayed that in her mad flight from the Duke of Ballywinkle
no harm might come to her.</p>

<p>The three men rode out into the broad highway at
the red bungalow and paused to listen.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got here yet. Only one person has passed,
and these must be the tracks of the girl’s horse,” said
Cooke, who had dismounted and struck matches, the
better to observe the faint hoof-prints in the hard shell
road.</p>

<p>“He’ll be along in a minute. Let us get into the
shadow of the bungalow, and when he comes we’ll ride
out and nail him. The bungalow’s a sort of way house.
I often stop here when I’m out on the estate and want
to rest. I have the key in my pocket.”</p>

<p>As Ardmore’s keys jingled in the lock Cooke cried out
softly. Their quarry was riding swiftly towards them,
and he drew rein before the bungalow as Cooke and
Collins rode out to meet him.</p>

<p>“I say,” panted the duke.</p>

<p>“You are our prisoner. Dismount and come into this
house.”</p>

<p>“Prisoner, you fool! I’m a guest at Ardsley, and
I’m looking for a lady.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very unlikely story.—Collins, help the gentleman
down;” and the reporter obeyed instructions with
so much zeal that the noble gentleman fell prone, and
was assisted to his feet with a fine mockery of helpfulness.</p>

<p>“I tell you I’m looking for a lady whose horse ran
away with her! I’m the Duke of Ballywinkle, and
brother-in-law to Mr. Ardmore. I’ll have you sent to
jail if you stop me here.”</p>

<p>“Come along, Duke, and we’ll see what you look
like,” said Cooke, leading the way to the bungalow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
veranda. Within Ardmore was lighting lamps. There
was a long room finished in black oak, with a fireplace
at one end, and a table in the centre. The floors were
covered with handsome rugs, and the walls were hung
with photographs and etchings. Ardmore sat on the
back of a leather settee in a pose assumed at the moment
of the duke’s entrance. It was a pose of entire nonchalance,
and Ardmore’s cap, perched on the back of
his head, and his brown hair rumpled boyishly, added
to the general effect of comfort and ease.</p>

<p>The duke blinked for a moment in the lamplight, then
he roared out joyously:</p>

<p>“Ardy, old man!” and advanced towards his brother-in-law
with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“Keep him off; he’s undoubtedly quite mad,” said
Ardmore, staring coldly, and bending his riding-crop
across his knees. “Collins, please ride on after the
lady and bring her back this way.”</p>

<p>Cooke had seated the prisoner rather rudely in a
chair, and the noble duke, having lost the power of speech
in amazement and fright, rubbed his eyes and then
fastened them incredulously on Ardmore; but there was
no question about it, he had been seized with violence;
he had been repudiated by his own brother-in-law—the
useless, stupid Tommy Ardmore, who at best had only
a child’s mind for pirate stories, and who was indubitably
the most negligible of negligible figures in the
drama of life as the duke knew it.</p>

<p>“Cooke,” began Ardmore, addressing his lieutenant
gravely from his perch on the settee, “what is the
charge against this person?”</p>

<p>“He says he’s a duke,” grinned Cooke, taking his cue
from Ardmore’s manner. “And he says he’s visiting at
Ardsley.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Ardmore with decision, “is creditable
only to the gentleman’s romantic imagination. His face
is anything but dukely, and there’s a red streak across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
it which points clearly to the recent sharp blow of a
weapon; and no one would ever strike a duke. It’s
utterly incredible,” and Ardmore lifted his brows and
leaned back with his arms at length and his hands clasping
the riding-crop, as he contemplated with supreme
satisfaction the tell-tale red line across the duke’s cheek.</p>

<p>The Duke of Ballywinkle leaped to his feet, the colour
that suffused his pale face hiding for the moment the
mark of the riding-stick.</p>

<p>“What the devil is this joke, Ardy?” screamed the
duke. “You know I’m a guest at your house; you
know I’m your sister’s husband. I was riding with Miss
Dangerfield, and her horse ran away with her, and she
may come to harm unless I go after her. This cut on
the face I got from a low limb of one of your infernal
trees. You are putting me in a devil of an embarrassing
position by holding me here.”</p>

<p>He spoke with dignity, and Ardmore heard him through
in silence; but when he had finished, the master of
Ardsley pointed to the chair.</p>

<p>“As I understand you, you are pleading not guilty;
and you pretend to some acquaintance with me; but I
am unable to recall you. We may have met somewhere,
sometime, but I really don’t know you. The title to
which you pretend is unfamiliar to me; but I will
frankly disclose to you that I, sir, am the governor of
North Carolina.”</p>

<p>“The what?” bleated the duke, his eyes bulging.</p>

<p>“I repeat, that I am the governor of North Carolina,
and as a state of war now exists in my unhappy kingdom,
I, sir, have assumed all the powers conferred upon
the three co-ordinate branches of government under the
American system—namely, or if you prefer it, I will say,
to wit: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
It is thus not only my privilege but my painful duty to
pass upon your case in all its sad aspects. As I have
already suspended the writ of habeas corpus and set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
aside the right to trial by jury, we will consider that I
sit here as the supreme court.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Ardy——” howled the duke.</p>

<p>“That remark I will not now construe as profanity,
but don’t let it occur again. The first charge against
you is that of insulting a woman on the Sunset Trail
in the estate called Ardsley, owned by a person known
in law as Thomas Ardmore. There are three witnesses
to the fact that you tried to stop a woman in the road,
and that streak on your face is even more conclusive.
Are you guilty or not guilty?”</p>

<p>“You are mad! You are crazy!” shouted the duke;
but his face was very white now, and the mark of the
crop flamed scarlet.</p>

<p>“You are guilty, beyond any question. But the
further charge against you that you pretend to be—what
did he say his name was, Cooke?—that you pretend
to be the Duke of Ballywinkle must now be considered.
That is quite right, is it; you say you are
the duke?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you fool!” howled the duke. “I’ll have the
law on you for this! I’ll appeal to the British ambassador.”</p>

<p>“I advise you not to appeal to anybody,” said Ardmore,
“and the British ambassador is without jurisdiction
in North Carolina. You have yourself asserted
that you are the Duke of Ballywinkle. Why Ballywinkle?
Why not Argyll? why not Westminster?
Why not, if duke you must be, the noble Duke of York?”</p>

<p>The Duke of Ballywinkle sat staring, stupefied. The
whole thing was one of his silly brother-in-law’s stupid
jokes; there was no question of that; and Tommy
Ardmore was always a bore; but in spite of the comfort
he derived from these reflections the duke was not a
little uneasy; for he had never seen his brother-in-law
in just this mood, and he did not like it. Ardmore was
carrying the joke too far; and there was an assurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
in Ardmore’s tone, and a light in Ardmore’s eyes, that
were ominous. Cooke had meanwhile lighted his pipe
and was calmly smoking until his chief should have his
fling.</p>

<p>Ardmore now drew from his pocket Johnston’s <i>American
Politics</i> with an air of greatest seriousness.</p>

<p>“Cooke,” he said, half to himself, as he turned the
pages, “do you remember just what the constitution
says about dukes? Oh yes, here we are! Now, Mr.
Duke of Ballywinkle, listen to what it says here in
Section IX. of the Constitution of the United States,
which reads exactly as follows in this book: ‘No title
of nobility shall be granted by the United States:
And no person holding any office of profit or trust under
them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept
of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind
whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.’ And
it says in Section X. that ‘No state shall grant any title
of nobility.’ Now, Mr. Ballywinkle, it is perfectly clear
that this government can’t recognize anything that it
can’t create, for that would be foolish. As I, the governor
of North Carolina, can’t make a duke, I can’t see
one. You are therefore wholly illegal; it’s against the
most sacred law of the land for you to be here at all;
and painful though it is to me, it is nevertheless my
duty to order you to leave the United States at once,
never to return. In fact, if you ever appear in the
United States again, I hereby order that you be hanged
by the neck until you be dead. One of Mr. Cooke’s men
will accompany you to New York to-morrow and see
to it that you take passage on a steamer bound for a
British port. The crime of having insulted a woman
will still hang over you until you are well east of Sandy
Hook, and I advise you not to risk being tried on that
charge in North Carolina, as my people are very impulsive
and emotional, and lynchings are not infrequent in our
midst. You shall spend to-night in my official caboose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
some distance from here, and your personal effects will
be brought from Ardsley, where, you have said, you are
a guest of Mr. Thomas Ardmore, who is officially unknown
to me. The supreme court will now adjourn.”</p>

<p>Cooke pulled the limp, bewildered duke to his feet,
and dragged him from the bungalow.</p>

<p>As they stepped out on the veranda Collins rode up
in alarm.</p>

<p>“I followed this road to a cross-road where it becomes
a bridle-path and runs off into the forest. There I lost
all trace of the lady, but here is her riding-crop.”</p>

<p>“Cooke, take your prisoner to the caboose; and, Collins,
come with me,” commanded Ardmore; and a moment
later he and the reporter rode off furiously in
search of Jerry Dangerfield.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br />


<small>MISS DANGERFIELD TAKES A PRISONER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A dozen</span> men carrying rifles across their saddle-bows
rode away from Habersham’s farm on the outskirts of
Turner Court House and struck a rough trail that led
a devious course over the hills. At their head rode the
guide of the expedition—a long, silent man on a mule.
Griswold and Habersham followed immediately behind
him on horseback. Their plans had been carefully
arranged before they left their rendezvous, and save for
an occasional brief interchange between the prosecuting
attorney and the governor’s special representative, the
party jogged on in silence. Habersham’s recruits were,
it may be said, farmers of the border, who had awaited
for years just such an opportunity as now offered to
avenge themselves upon the insolent Appleweights.
Nearly every man of the party had some private score
to settle, but they had all been sworn as special constables,
and were sobered by the knowledge that the
power of the state of South Carolina was back of them.</p>

<p>Thus, at the very hour that Mr. Ardmore and his lieutenants
rode away from the lonely anchorage of the
caboose, Professor Griswold and his cavalcade set out
for Mount Nebo Church. While the master of Ardsley
was revenging himself upon the Duke of Ballywinkle,
his dearest friend, against whom he had closed the doors
of his house, was losing no time in setting forth upon a
mission which, if successful, would seriously interfere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
with all Mr. Ardmore’s hopes and plans. Ardmore’s
scarlet fever telegram no longer rankled in the breast
of the associate professor of admiralty of the University
of Virginia, for Griswold knew that no matter what
might be the outcome of his effort to uphold the dignity
of the sovereign state of South Carolina, his participation
in any such adventure would so cover his friend
with envy that he would have him for ever at his mercy.
Thomas Ardmore deserved punishment—there was no
doubt of that, and as Professor Griswold was not more
or less than a human being, he took comfort of the
reflection.</p>

<p>The guide of the expedition pushed his mule forward
at a fast walk, making no excuses to Griswold and Habersham
for the roughness of the trails he chose, nor troubling
to give warning of sharp turns where a horse, being
less wise than a mule, tobogganed madly before finding
a foothold. Occasionally a low-hanging limb switched
the associate professor sharply across the face, but his
temper continued serene where the trail was darkest
and steepest, and he found himself ignoring Habersham’s
occasional polite questions about the university in his
effort to summon up in memory certain ways of Barbara
Osborne which baffled him. He deplored the time he
had given to the study of a stupid profession like the
law, when, if he had applied himself with equal diligence
to poetry, he might have made for himself a place at
least as high in belles-lettres. In his college days he
had sometimes thrummed a guitar, and there was a
little song in his heart, half formed, and with only a line
or two as yet tangible, which he felt sure he could write
down on paper if it were not that the bugles summoned
him to war; it was a song of a white rose which a lover
wore in his heart, through winter and summer, and it
never changed, and the flight of the seasons had no
manner of effect on it.</p>

<p>“Check up, cain’t you?” snarled the man on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
mule, laying hold of Griswold’s rein; and thus halted,
Griswold found that they had been circling round a curiously
symmetrical, thickly wooded hill, and had finally
come to a clearing whence they were able to gaze far
off toward the north.</p>

<p>“We are almost out of bounds,” said Habersham,
pointing. “Over there somewhere, across the hills, lies
North Carolina. I am as thoroughly lost as you can
possibly be; but these men know where they are.—How
far is it, Billy”—he addressed the silent guide—“to
Mount Nebo?”</p>

<p>“About four mile, and I reckon we’d better let out a
leetle now, or they’ll sing the doxology before we git
thar.”</p>

<p>“What’s that light away off there?” asked Habersham.</p>

<p>The guide paused to examine it, and the faint glow
far down the vale seemed to perplex him. He spoke to
one or two other natives, and they viewed the light
ruminatively, as is their way.</p>

<p>“Thet must be on Ardmore’s land,” said the leader
finally. “It shoots out all sorts o’ ways round hyeh, and
I reckon thet’s about wheh Raccoon Creek cuts through.”</p>

<p>“That’s very likely,” said Habersham. “I’ve seen
the plat of what Ardmore owns on this side the border
at the court house, and I remember that there’s a long
strip in Mingo County that is Ardsley land. Ardmore
has houses of one kind and another scattered all over the
estate, and those lights may be from one of them. You
know the place, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve visited there,” admitted Griswold. “But
we’d better give it a wide berth. The whole estate is
simply infested with scarlet fever. They’re quarantined.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s a joke,” said Habersham. “There’s
a big party on there now, and I have seen some of the
guests in Turner’s within a day or two.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“Within how many days?” demanded Griswold, his
heart sinking at the thought that Ardmore had lied to
him to keep him away from Ardsley—from Ardmore’s
house! The thought of it really hurt him now. Could
it be possible that Ardmore had guests so distinguished
that he, Griswold, was not worthy to make their acquaintance!
He experienced a real pang as he thought that
here he was, within a short ride of the home of his
dearest friend, the man whom most he loved of all men,
and that he had been denied the door of that friend’s house.</p>

<p>“Come on!” called Habersham.</p>

<p>Half the company rode ahead to gain the farther side
of the church; the remainder, including Griswold and
Habersham, soon dismounted and tied their horses out
of sight of the country road which they had latterly
been following.</p>

<p>“We are in plenty of time,” said Habersham, looking
at his watch. “The rest of the boys are closing in from
the other side, and they will be ready for Appleweight
when he finishes his devotions. We’ve been studying
the old man’s habits, and he has a particular place where
he ties his horse back of the church. It’s a little apart
from the fence where most of the congregation hitch,
and he chose it, no doubt, because in case of a surprise
he would have plenty of room for manoeuvring. Two
men are going to lay for him, seize and gag him, and
carry him into the wood back of the church; and then
we’re off across the state line to lock him up in jail at
Kildare and give Governor Dangerfield the shock of his
life.”</p>

<p>“It sounds simple enough; but it won’t be long
before Appleweight’s friends miss him. You must remember
that they are a shrewd lot.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to take our chances. Let’s hope we are
as shrewd as they are,” replied Habersham.</p>

<p>They moved softly through the wood, and presently
the faint sound of singing reached them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Old Rabdick has finished his sermon, and we’ll know
the worst in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>One of the party had already detached himself and
crept forward toward the church, to meet his appointed
comrade in the enterprise, who was to come in from the
other side.</p>

<p>The clapboard church presented in the moonlight the
austerest outlines, and as the men waited, a rude though
unseen hand was slamming the wooden shutters that
protected the windows from impious violence.</p>

<p>“We could do with less moon,” muttered Habersham,
as he and Griswold peered through the trees into the
churchyard.</p>

<p>“There goes Bill Appleweight now,” whispered one of
the natives at his elbow, and Griswold felt his heart-beats
quicken as he watched a tall figure silhouetted
against the church and moving swiftly toward the rear
of the building. At the front of the church voices
sounded, as the departing worshippers rode or drove
slowly away.</p>

<p>Habersham laid his hand suddenly on Griswold’s arm.</p>

<p>“They’ve got him! They’ve nailed him! See!
There! They’re yanking him back into the timber.
They’ve taken him and his horse!”</p>

<p>Griswold saw nothing but a momentary confusion of
shadows, then perfect silence hung over the woods behind
the little church. The congregation was slowly
dispersing, riding away in little groups. Suddenly a
voice called out in the road a hundred yards beyond the
church:</p>

<p>“Hey there! Where’s Bill?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s gone long ago!” yelled another.</p>

<p>In a moment more the church door slammed and a
last figure rode rapidly away.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll see what’s happened,” said Habersham.
“It looks almost too easy.”</p>

<p>The members of Griswold’s party who had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
thrown round to the farther side of the church began to
appear, one at a time. There was no nervousness among
any of the band—a fact that impressed Griswold. They
were all risking much in this enterprise, but they were
outwardly unperturbed, and chewing their tobacco
silently while they awaited the return of the two active
agents in the conspiracy who had dealt directly with
Appleweight. Habersham counted heads, and announced
all present or accounted for.</p>

<p>The tall leader who had ridden the mule was the first
to rise out of the underbrush, through which he had
crawled circuitously from the rear of the church. His
companion followed a few seconds later.</p>

<p>“We’ve got Bill, all tied and gagged and a-settin’ of
his hoss,” drawled the leader, “and the hoss is tied to
the back fence. Rest o’ his boys thought he’d gone
ahead, but they may miss him and come back. He’s
safe enough, and ef we keep away from him we’ll be
ready to light out ef the gang scents trouble and comes
back to look fer Bill.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure he’s tied up so he can’t break away or
yell?”</p>

<p>“He’s as good as dead, a-settin’ of his hoss in the
thicket back theh.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said Habersham, “what we’ve got to do
is to make a run for it and land him across the border,
and stick him into a North Carolina jail, where he rightfully
belongs. The question is, can we do it all in one
night, or had we better lock him up somewhere on this
side the line and take another night for it? The sheriff
over there in Kildare is Appleweight’s cousin, but we’ll
lock him up with Bill, to make a family party of it.”</p>

<p>“We’d better not try too much to-night,” counselled
Griswold. “It’s a big thing to have the man himself.
If it were not for the matter of putting Governor Dangerfield
in a hole, I’d favour hurrying with Appleweight to
Columbia, just for the moral effect of it on the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
of South Carolina. We’d make a big killing for the
administration that way, Habersham.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’d make a killing all right, but you’d have
Bill Appleweight on your hands, which Governor Osborne
has not until lately been anxious for,” replied
Habersham, in a low tone that was heard by no one
but his old preceptor.</p>

<p>“You’d better get over the idea that we’re afraid of
this outlaw,” rejoined Griswold. “The governor of
North Carolina dare not call his soul his own where
these hill people are concerned; but the governor of
South Carolina is a different sort.”</p>

<p>“The governor of North Carolina is filling the newspapers
with his own virtuous intentions in the matter,”
remarked Habersham, “but his sudden zeal puts one
upon inquiry.”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t imply that the motives of the governor
of South Carolina are not the worthiest?” demanded
Griswold hotly.</p>

<p>“Most certainly not!” returned the prosecuting attorney;
but a smile flitted across his face—a smile which,
in the darkness, Griswold did not see. “The two governors
are very different men—wholly antipodal characters,
in fact,” and again Habersham smiled to himself.</p>

<p>While they thus stood on South Carolina soil, waiting
for the safe and complete dispersion of the Mount Nebo
congregation before seizing the captive they had gagged
and tied at the rear of the little church, the fates were
ordering a very different termination of the night’s business.</p>

<p>Miss Jerry Dangerfield, galloping away from the Duke
of Ballywinkle, with no thought but to widen the distance
between them, turned off at the first cross-road,
which began well enough, but degenerated rapidly into
a miserable trail, through which she was obliged to walk
her horse. Before she was aware of it she was in the
midst of a clearing where labourers had lately been cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
timber, and she found, on turning to make her way
out, that she was quite lost, for three trails, all seemingly
alike, struck off into the forest. She spoke aloud
to the horse to reassure herself, and smiled as she viewed
the grim phalanx of stumps. She must, however, find
her way back to Ardsley, for there were times when
Jerry Dangerfield could be very serious with herself,
though it rarely pleased her to be serious with other
people; and she knew that the time had long passed
for her return to the house. If her conspiracy with
Thomas Ardmore had proved successful, the duke would
not return to the great house; but her own prolonged
absence was something that had not been in her programme.</p>

<p>She did not know then that three men had witnessed
her flight from the duke, or that they had taken swift
vengeance upon him for his unpardonable conduct in
the moon-blanched road. It was not Jerry’s way to
accept misfortune tamely, and after circling the wall of
timber that shut her in, in the hope of determining
where she had entered, she chose a trail at random and
plunged into the woods. She assumed that probably all
the roads and paths on the estate led more or less directly,
to the great house or to some lodge or bungalow. She
had lost her riding-crop in her mad flight, and she broke
off a switch, tossing its leaves into the moonlight and
laughing softly as they rained about her.</p>

<p>Jerry began whistling gently to herself, for she had
never been lost before, and it is not so bad when you
have a good horse, a fair path, sweet, odorous woods,
and the moon to keep you company. She forded a
brook that was silver to eye and ear, and let her horse
stand midway of it for joy in the sight and sound. She
had kept no account of time, but rather imagined that
it had not been more than half an hour since the Duke
of Ballywinkle left her so unceremoniously.</p>

<p>Suddenly ahead of her through the woods floated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
sound of singing—one of those strange, wavering <i>pieux
cantiques</i> peculiar to the South. She rode on, thinking
to find help and a guide back to Ardsley; then the
music ceased, and lights now flashed faintly before her,
but she went forward guardedly.</p>

<p>“I’m much more lost than I thought I was, for I
must be away off the estate,” she reflected. She turned
and rode back a few rods and dismounted, and tied her
horse to a sapling. She was disappointed at not finding
a camp of Ardmore’s woodcutters, to whom she could
unhesitatingly have confided herself; but it seemed wise
now to exercise caution in drawing to herself the attention
of strangers. She did not know that she had
crossed the state line and was in South Carolina, or
that the singing she had heard floated from the windows
of Mount Nebo Church.</p>

<p>She became now the astonished witness of a series of
incidents that occurred so swiftly as fairly to take her
breath away. A tall, loosely articulated man came from
the direction of the church and walked toward her. She
knelt at the tree and watched, the moonlight giving her
a clear view of a rustic somewhat past middle age, whose
chief characteristic seemed to be a grizzled beard and
long arms that swung oddly at his side. The brim of
his wool hat was turned up sharply from his forehead,
and she had a glimpse of the small, keen gray eyes with
which he swept the forest before him. He freed a horse
which she had not before noticed, and she concluded
that he would not approach nearer, for she expected
him to mount and ride away to join others of the congregation
whom she heard making off in a road beyond
the church. Then, with a quickness and deftness that
baffled her eyes, two men rose beside him just as he was
about to mount; there was no outcry and no sound of
scuffling, so quick was the descent and so perfect the
understanding between the captors. In a moment the
man was gathered up, bound, and flung on his saddle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
She had a better view of him, now that he was hatless,
though a gag had been forced into his mouth and a
handkerchief tied over his eyes, so that he presented a
grotesque appearance. Jerry was so absorbed that she
forgot to be afraid; never in her life had she witnessed
anything so amazing as this; and now, to her more
complete bewilderment, the captors, after carefully inspecting
their work and finding it satisfactory, seemed
to disappear utterly from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>In the woods to her left she thought she heard a horse
neigh; then she saw shadows moving in that direction;
and again, from the road, she heard the brief debate of
the two men as to the whereabouts of “Bill;” and it
struck Jerry humorously that he would not soon see his
friends unless they came and helped him out of his
predicament.</p>

<p>It may help to an understanding of Miss Jerry Dangerfield’s
character if it is recorded here that never in her
short life had she failed to respond to the call of impulse.
She was lost in the woods, and strange men
lurked about; a man had been attacked, seized, and
left sitting in a state of absurd helplessness on a horse
presumably his own, and there was no guessing what
dire penalty his captors had in store for him. He certainly
looked deliciously funny as he sat there in the
shadows, vigorously twisting his arms and head in an
effort to free himself.</p>

<p>Quiet reigned in the neighbourhood of the church; the
lights had blinked out; the bang of the closing shutters
reassured Jerry, and she crept on her knees toward the
unconscious captive, loosed his horse’s rein, and led it
rapidly toward her own horse, a little farther back in
the woods. Her blindfolded prisoner, thinking his
original captors were carrying him off, renewed his
efforts to free himself. He tested the ropes and straps
with which he was fastened by throwing himself first
to one side, then to the other, as far as his gyves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
would permit, at the same time frothily chewing his
gag.</p>

<p>Jerry gained her own saddle in the least bit of a panic,
and when she had mounted and made sure of the leading-strap
with which her prisoner’s horse was provided, she
rode on at a rapid walk until she reached the clearing,
where the stumps again grimly mocked her. She stopped
to listen, and heard through the still night first one cry
and then many voices in various keys of alarm and rage.
Then she bent toward the prisoner, tore the bandage
from his eyes, and with more difficulty freed him of the
gag. He blinked and spluttered at this unexpected deliverance,
then blinked and spluttered afresh at seeing
that his captor was a young woman, who was plainly
not of his world. Jerry watched him wonderingly, then
addressed him in her most agreeable tone.</p>

<p>“You were caught and tied by two men over there by
a church. I saw them, and when they went off and left
you, I came along and brought you with me, thinking
to save your life. I want to get home as quickly as
possible, and though I do not know you, and am quite
sure we never met before, I hope you will kindly guide
me to Ardsley, and thereby render me a service I shall
always deeply appreciate.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bill Appleweight, <i>alias</i> Poteet, was well hardened
to the shocks of time, but this pleasant-voiced girl,
coolly sitting her horse, and holding his own lank steed
by a strap, was the most amazing human being that had
yet dawned on his horizon. He was not stupid, but
Jerry’s manner of speech had baffled more sophisticated
minds than Appleweight’s, and the sweet sincerity of
her tone, and her frank countenance, hallowed as it
was by the moonlight, wrought in the outlaw’s mind
a befuddlement not wholly unlike that which had
possessed the wits of many young gallants south of
the Potomac who had laid siege to Jerry Dangerfield’s
heart. But the cries behind them were more pronounced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
and Appleweight was nothing if not a man of
action.</p>

<p>“Take these things off’n me,” he commanded fiercely,
“and I’ll see y’ safe to Ardsley.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied Jerry, who was herself not
unmindful of the voices behind. “You will kindly tell
me the way, and I will accommodate my pace to that
of your own somewhat ill-nourished beast. And as
there’s a mob looking for you back there, all ready to
hang you to one of these noble forest trees, I advise you
to use more haste and less caution in pointing the way.”</p>

<p>Appleweight lifted his head and took his bearings.
Then he nodded toward one of the three trails which
had so baffled Jerry when first she broke into the clearing.</p>

<p>“Thet’s the nighest,” said Appleweight, “and we’d
better git.”</p>

<p>She set the pace at a trot, and was relieved in a few
minutes to pass one or two landmarks which she remembered
from her flight through the woods. As they
splashed through the brook she had forded, she was quite
confident that the captive was playing her no trick, but
that in due course she should strike the highroad to
Ardsley which she had abandoned to throw off the Duke
of Ballywinkle.</p>

<p>It was now ten o’clock, and the moon was sinking
behind the forest trees. Jerry took advantage of an
occasional straight strip of road to go forward at a
gallop, but these stretches did not offer frequently, and
the two riders kept pretty steadily to a smart trot. They
presented a droll picture as they moved through the
forest—the girl, riding cross-saddle, with the stolen
captive trailing after. Occasionally Mr. Appleweight
seemed to be talking to himself, but whether he was
praying or swearing Jerry did not trouble herself to
decide. It was enough for her that she had found a
guide out of the wilderness by stealing a prisoner from
his enemies, and this was amusing, and sent bubbling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
in her heart those quiet springs of mirth that accounted
for so much in Jerry Dangerfield.</p>

<p>As they walked their horses through a bit of sand the
prisoner spoke:</p>

<p>“Who air y’u, little gal?”</p>

<p>Jerry turned in the saddle, so that Appleweight enjoyed
a full view of her face.</p>

<p>“I am perfectly willing to tell you my name, but first
it would be more courteous for you to tell me yours,
particularly as I am delivering you from a band of outlaws
who undoubtedly intended to do you harm.”</p>

<p>“I reckon they air skeered to foller us, gal. They air
afeard to tackle th’ ole man, onless they jump in two t’
one; and they cain’t tell who helped me git away.”</p>

<p>He laughed—a curious, chuckling laugh. He had
ceased to struggle at his bonds, but seemed resigned to
his strange fate. He had not answered Jerry’s question,
and had no intention of doing so. The sudden attack at
the church had aroused all his cunning. Appleweight,
<i>alias</i> Poteet, was an old wolf, and knew well the ways of
the trapper; but the bold attempt to kidnap him was a
new feature of the game as heretofore played along the
border. He did not make it out; nor was he wholly
satisfied with the girl’s explanation of her own presence
in that out-of-the-way place. She might be a guest at
Ardsley, as she pretended, but women-folk were rarely
seen on the estate, and never in such remote corners of
it as Mount Nebo Church. As he pondered the matter,
it seemed incredible that this remarkable young person,
whose innocence was so beguiling, should be in any way
leagued with his foes.</p>

<p>He had several times called out directions as they
crossed other paths in the forest, and they now reached
the main trunk road of the estate. The red bungalow,
Jerry knew, was not far away. Her prisoner spoke
again.</p>

<p>“Little gal, I’m an ole man, and I hain’t never done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
y’u no harm. Your haouse is only a leetle way up thar,
and I cain’t be no more use to y’u. I want t’ go home,
and if y’u’ll holp me ontie this yere harness——” and
he grinned as he viewed his bonds in the fuller light of
the open road.</p>

<p>Then hoof-beats thumped the soft earth of another of
the trails that converged at this point, and Ardmore and
Collins flashed out upon Jerry and her captive, amid
a wild panic of horses.</p>

<p>Appleweight twisted and turned in his saddle, but
Jerry instantly held up her hand and arrested the inquiries
of her deliverers.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore, this gentleman was most rudely set
upon by two strangers as he was leaving a church over
there somewhere in the woods. I was lost, and as his
appearance at the time and place seemed almost providential,
I begged him to guide me toward home, which
he has most courteously done;” and Jerry, to give the
proper touch to her explanation, twitched the strap by
which she held her prisoner’s horse, so that it danced,
adding a fresh absurdity to the wobbling figure of its
bound rider.</p>

<p>“You are safe!” cried Ardmore in a low tone, to
which Jerry nodded carelessly, in a way that directed
attention to the more immediate business at hand. He
was not at once sure of his cue, but there seemed to be
something familiar in the outlines of the man on horseback,
and full identification broke upon him now with
astounding vividness.</p>

<p>“Jugs,” he began, addressing the prisoner smilingly,
“dear old Jugs, to think we should meet again! Since
you handed me that jug on the rear end of the train, a
few nights ago, life has had new meanings for me, and
I’m just as sorry as can be that I gave you the buttermilk.
I wouldn’t have done such a thing for billions
in real money. And now that you have fallen into the
excellent hands of Miss Dangerfield——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Dangerfield!” screamed the prisoner, lifting himself
as high in the saddle as his bonds would permit.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Ardmore. “Your rescuer is none
other than Miss Geraldine Dangerfield.”</p>

<p>“Why, gal,” began the outlaw, “ef your pa’s the
guv’nor of No’th Caroline, him an’ me’s old frien’s.”</p>

<p>“Then will you kindly tell me your name?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Allow me to complete the introductions,” interrupted
Collins, who had hung back in silence. “Unless
my eyes deceive me, which is wholly improbable, this is
a gentleman whom I once interviewed in the county jail
at Raleigh, and he was known at that time as William
Appleweight, <i>alias</i> Poteet.”</p>

<p>“You air right,” admitted the prisoner without hesitation;
and then, addressing Jerry: “Yer pa would
be glad to know his dorter had helped an ole frien’ like
me, gal. Ye may hev heard him speak o’ me.”</p>

<p>“But how about that message in the cork of the jug
you put on the train at Kildare?” demanded Ardmore.
“And why did you send your brother to try to scare
me to death at Raleigh?”</p>

<p>“That is not the slightest importance,” interrupted
Jerry, gently playing with the tether which held Mr.
Appleweight; “nor does it matter that papa and this
gentleman are friends. If this is, indeed, the famous
outlaw, Mr. William Appleweight, then, papa or no
papa, friend or no friend, he is a prisoner of the state
of North Carolina.”</p>

<p>“Pris’ner!” bawled Appleweight—“an’ you the guv’nor’s
gal——”</p>

<p>“You have hit the situation exactly, Mr. Appleweight;
and as far as the office of governor is concerned, it is
capably filled by the young gentleman on your left, Mr.
Thomas Ardmore. Let us now adjourn to his house,
where, if I am not mistaken, a bit of cold fowl is usually
to be found on the sideboard at this hour. But hold”—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Jerry checked her horse—“where can we lodge this
gentleman, Mr. Ardmore, until we decide upon his
further fate?”</p>

<p>“We might put him in the wine cellar,” suggested
Ardmore.</p>

<p>“No,” interposed Collins. “I fancy that much of your
fluid stock has paid revenue tax, and most of it has
passed none too lightly through the custom-house. It
would be unwarrantably cruel to lock Mr. Appleweight
in such quarters, with the visible marks of taxation all
around him. Still, the sight of the stamps would probably
destroy his thirst, though his rugged independence
might so far assert itself that he would smash a few of
your most expensive importations out of sheer deviltry.”</p>

<p>“He shall be treated with the greatest consideration,”
said Jerry; and thereafter, no further adventure befalling
them, they reached Ardsley, where their arrival
occasioned the greatest excitement.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />


<small>A MEETING OF OLD FRIENDS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Habersham’s</span> men had proved exceedingly timid when
it came to the business of threshing the woods for Appleweight,
whom they regarded with a new awe, now that
he had vanished so mysteriously. They had searched
the woods guardedly, but the narrow paths that led
away into the dim fastnesses of Ardsley were forbidding,
and these men were not without their superstitions.
They had awaited for years an opportunity to strike at
the Appleweight faction; they had at last taken their
shot, and had seemingly brought down their bird; but
their lack of spirit in retrieving the game had been
their undoing. They had only aroused their most formidable
enemy, who would undoubtedly lose no time
in seeking revenge. They were a dolorous band who,
after warily beating the woods, dispersed in the small
hours of the morning, having found nothing but Appleweight’s
wool hat, which only added to their mystification.</p>

<p>“We ought to have taken him away on the run,” said
Habersham bitterly, as he and Griswold discussed the
matter on the veranda of the prosecutor’s house and
watched the coming of the dawn. “I didn’t realize that
those fellows lived in such mortal terror of the old man;
but they refused to make off with him until the last of
his friends had got well out of the way. I ought to
have had more sense myself than to have expected the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
old fox to sit tied up like a calf ready for market. We
had all his friends accounted for—those that weren’t at
prayer meeting were marked down somewhere else, and
we had a line flung pretty well round the church. Appleweight’s
deliverance must have come from somewhere
inside the Ardmore property. Perhaps the game warden
picked him up.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the Indians captured him,” suggested Griswold,
yawning, “or maybe some Martian came down on
a parachute and hauled him up. Or, as scarlet fever is
raging at Mr. Ardmore’s castle”—and his tone was icy—“Appleweight
was probably seized all of a sudden,
and broke away in his delirium. Let’s go to bed.”</p>

<p>At eight o’clock he and Habersham rode into Turner
Court House, and Griswold went at once to the inn to
change his clothes. No further steps could be taken until
some definite report was received as to Appleweight’s
whereabouts. The men who had attempted the outlaw’s
capture had returned to their farms, and were
most demurely cultivating the soil. Griswold was thoroughly
disgusted at the ridiculous failure of Habersham’s
plans, and not less severe upon himself for failing
to push matters to a conclusion the moment the
outlaw was caught, instead of hanging back to await the
safe dispersion of the Mount Nebo congregation.</p>

<p>It had been the most puerile transaction possible, and
he was aware that a report of it, which he must wire at
once to Miss Barbara Osborne, would not impress that
young woman with his capacity or trustworthiness in
difficult occasions. The iron that had already entered
into his soul drove deeper. He had ordered a fresh
horse, and was resolved to return to Mount Nebo Church
for a personal study of the ground in broad daylight.</p>

<p>As he crossed the musty parlour of the little hotel, to
his great astonishment Miss Osborne’s black Phœbe,
stationed where her eyes ranged the whole lower floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
of the inn, drew attention to herself in an elaborate
courtesy.</p>

<p>“Miss Barb’ra wish me t’ say she done come heah on
business, and she like fo’ to see yo’ all right away. She
done bring huh seddle, and war a-gwine ridin’ twell you
come back. She’s a-gittin’ ready, and I’ll go tell huh
you done come. She got a heap o’ trubble, thet young
missis, so she hev,” and the black woman’s pursed lips
seemed to imply that Professor Griswold was in some
measure responsible for Miss Osborne’s difficulties.</p>

<p>As he stared out into the street a negro brought a
horse bearing a better saddle than Mingo County had
ever boasted, and hitched it near the horse he had
secured for himself. An instant later he heard a quick
step above, and Miss Osborne, sedately followed by the
black woman, came downstairs. She smiled and greeted
him cordially, but there was trouble in her brown
eyes.</p>

<p>“I didn’t warn you of my coming. I didn’t want to
be a nuisance to you; but there’s a new—a most unaccountable
perplexity. It doesn’t seem right to burden
you with it—you have already been so kind about helping
me; but I dare not turn to our oldest friends—I
have been afraid to trust father’s friends at all since
Mr. Bosworth acted so traitorously.”</p>

<p>“My time is entirely at your service, Miss Osborne;
but I have a shameful report to make of myself. I must
tell you how miserably I have failed, before you trust
me any further. We—that is to say, the prosecuting
attorney of this county and a party he got together of
Appleweight’s enemies—caught the outlaw last night—took
him with the greatest ease—but he got away from
us! It was all my fault, and I’m deeply disgusted with
myself!”</p>

<p>He described the capture and the subsequent mysterious
disappearance of Appleweight, and confessed the
obvious necessity for great caution in further attempts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
to take the outlaw, now that he was on guard. Barbara
laughed reassuringly at the end of the story.</p>

<p>“Those men must have felt funny when they went
back to get the prisoner and found that he had gone up
into the air. But there’s a new feature of the case
that’s more serious than the loss of this man——” and
the trouble again possessed her eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s better not to have our problems too simple.
Any lawyer can win an easy case—though I seem to have
lost my first one for you,” he added penitently.</p>

<p>She made no reply, but drew from her purse a cutting
from a newspaper and handed it to him.</p>

<p>“That’s from last night’s Columbia <i>Vidette</i>, which is
very hostile to my father.”</p>

<p>He was already running over the heavily leaded column
that set forth without equivocation the fact that Governor
Osborne had not been in Columbia since he went to
New Orleans. It scouted the story that he was abroad
in the state on official business connected with the
Appleweight case—the yam which Griswold had forced
upon the friendly reporter at the telegraph office in
Columbia. The governor of a state, the <i>Vidette</i> went on
to elaborate, could not vanish without leaving some
trace of himself, and a <i>Vidette</i> representative had traced
the steps of Governor Osborne from New Orleans until—the
italics are the <i>Vidette’s</i>—he had again entered
South Carolina <i>under cover of night and for purposes
which, for the honour of the state, the Vidette hesitated
to disclose</i>.</p>

<p>The writer of the article had exhausted the possibilities
of gentle suggestion and vague innuendo in an effort
to create an impression of mystery and to pique curiosity
as to further developments, which were promised at any
hour. Griswold’s wrath was aroused, not so much
against the newspaper, which he assumed had some fire
for its smothered trifle of smoke, but against the governor
of South Carolina himself, who was causing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
finest and noblest girl in the world infinite anxiety and
pain.</p>

<p>“The thing is preposterous,” he said lightly. “The
idea that your father would attempt to enter his own
state surreptitiously is inconceivable in these days when
public men are denied all privacy, and when it’s any
man’s right to deceive the press if he finds it essential
to his own comfort and peace; but the intimation that
your father is in South Carolina for any dishonourable
purpose is preposterous. One thing, however, is certain,
Miss Osborne, and that is that we must produce your
father at the earliest possible moment.”</p>

<p>“But”—and Barbara hesitated, and her eyes, near
tears as they were, wrought great havoc in Griswold’s
soul—“but father must not be found until this Appleweight
matter is settled. You understand without
making me speak the words—that he might not exactly
view the matter as we do.”</p>

<p>It was a painful subject; and the fact that she was
driven by sheer force of circumstances to appeal to him,
a stranger, to aid her to perform a public service in her
father’s name rallied all his good impulses to her standard.
It was too delicate a matter for discussion; it
was a thing to be ignored; and he assumed at once a
lighter tone.</p>

<p>“Come! We must solve the riddle of the lost prisoner
at once, and your father will undoubtedly give an excellent
account of himself when he gets ready. Meanwhile
the fiction that he is personally carrying the war
into the Appleweight country must be maintained, and
I shall step to the railway station and wire the Columbia
newspaper in his name that he is in Mingo County on
the trail of the outlaws.”</p>

<p>The messages were composed by their joint efforts at
the station, with not so much haste but that an associate
professor of admiralty, twenty-nine years old, could defer
in the most trifling matters to the superior literary taste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
of a girl of twenty whose brown eyes were very pleasant
to meet in moments of uncertainty and appeal.</p>

<p>He signed the messages Charles Osborne, Governor,
with a flourish indicative of the increased confidence
and daring which Miss Osborne’s arrival had brought to
the situation.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Griswold, as they rode through the
meagre streets of Turner’s, “we will go to Mount Nebo
Church and see what we can learn of Appleweight’s
disappearance.”</p>

<p>“The North Carolina papers are making a great deal
of Governor Dangerfield’s activity in trying to put down
outlawry on the border,” said Barbara. “Marked copies
of the newspapers are pouring into papa’s office. I can
but hold Mr. Bosworth responsible for that. We may
count upon it that he will do all in his power to annoy
us”—and then, as Griswold looked at her quickly, he
was aware that she had coloured and averted her eyes;
and while, as a lawyer, he was aware that words of two
letters might be provocative of endless litigation of the
bitterest sort, he had never known before that us, in
itself the homeliest of words, could cause so sweet a
distress. It seemed that an interval of several years
passed before either spoke again.</p>

<p>“We are quite near the estate of your friend, Mr.
Ardmore, aren’t we?” asked Barbara presently.</p>

<p>“I fancy we are,” replied Griswold, but with a tone
so coldly at variance with his previous cordial references
to the master of Ardsley that Barbara looked at him
inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry that I should have given you the impression,
Miss Osborne, that Mr. Ardmore and I are friends,
as I undoubtedly did at Columbia. He has, for some
unaccountable reason, cut my acquaintance in a manner
so unlike him that I do not pretend to explain it; nor,
I may add, is it of the least importance.”</p>

<p>“I was a little surprised,” returned Barbara, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
truly feminine instinct for mingling in the balm of consolation
the bitterest and most poisonous herbs, “that
you should have had for a friend a man who frankly
follows girls whose appearance he fancies. Even Mr.
Ardmore’s democratic enthusiasm for the downtrodden
laundry girl does not wholly mitigate the winking
episode.”</p>

<p>“He had, only a few days ago, invited me to visit
him, though I had been to his house so often that the
obscurest servant knew that I was privileged even beyond
the members of Mr. Ardmore’s own family in my
freedom of the place. When I saw that his house would
be a convenient point from which to study the Appleweight
situation, I wired him that I was on the way,
and to my utter amazement he replied that he could
not entertain me—that scarlet fever was epidemic on
the estate—on those almost uncounted acres!”</p>

<p>And with a gulp and a mist in his eyes, Griswold
drew rein and pointed, from a hill that had now borne
them to a considerable height, toward Ardsley itself,
dreamily basking in the bright morning sunlight within
its cinture of hills, meadows, and forest.</p>

<p>“I never saw the place before! It’s perfectly splendid!”
cried Barbara, forgetting that Griswold must be
gazing upon it with the eyes of an exile viewing grim,
forbidding battlements that once hailed him in welcome.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the most interesting houses in America,”
observed Griswold, who strove at all times to be just.</p>

<p>“There’s a flag flying—I can’t make out what it is,”
said Barbara.</p>

<p>“It’s probably to give warning of the scarlet fever;
it would be like Ardy to do that. But we must hurry
on to Mount Nebo.”</p>

<p>He knew the ways of Ardsley thoroughly; better, in
fact, than its owner ever had in old times; but in his
anger at Ardmore he would not set foot on the estate
if he could possibly avoid doing so in reaching the scene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
of the night’s contretemps. He found without difficulty
the trail taken by Habersham’s men, and in due course
of time they left their horses a short distance from the
church and proceeded on foot.</p>

<p>“It seems all the stupider in broad daylight,” said
Griswold, after he had explained just what had occurred,
and how the captors, in their superstitious awe of Appleweight,
had been afraid to carry him off the moment
they were sure of him, but had slipped back among their
fellows to wait until the coast was perfectly clear. To
ease his deep chagrin Barbara laughed a good deal at
the occurrence as they tramped over the scene discussing
it. They went into the woods back of the church,
where Griswold began to exercise his reasoning powers.</p>

<p>“Some one must have come in from this direction
and freed the man and taken him away,” he declared.</p>

<p>He knelt and marked the hoof-prints where Appleweight
had been left tied; but the grass here was much
trampled, and Griswold was misled by the fact, not
knowing that news of Appleweight’s strange disappearance
had passed among the outlaw’s friends by the
swift telegraphy of the border, and that the whole neighbourhood
had been threshed over hours before. It
might have been some small consolation to Griswold
had he known that Appleweight’s friends and accomplices
were as much at a loss to know what had become
of the chieftain as the men who had tried so ineffectually
to kidnap him. From the appearance of the trampled
grass many men had taken a hand in releasing the
prisoner, and this impression did not clarify matters for
Griswold.</p>

<p>“Where does this path lead?” asked Barbara.</p>

<p>“This is Ardsley land here, this side of the church,
and that trail leads on, if I remember, to the main
Ardsley highway, with which various other roads are
connected—many miles in all. It’s inconceivable that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
the deliverers of this outlaw should have taken him into
the estate, where a sort of police system is maintained
by the forestry corps. I don’t at all make it out.”</p>

<p>He went off to explore the heavy woods on each side
of the trail that led into Ardsley, but without result.
When he came gloomily back he found that in his absence
Barbara had followed the bridle-path for a considerable
distance, and she held out to him a diminutive
pocket handkerchief, which had evidently been snatched
away from its owner—so Barbara explained—by a low-hanging
branch of an oak, and flung into a blackberry
bush, where she had found it. It was a trifle, indeed,
the slightest bit of linen, which they held between them
by its four corners and gravely inspected.</p>

<p>“Feminine, beyond a doubt,” pronounced Griswold
sagely.</p>

<p>“It’s a good handkerchief, and here are two initials
worked in the corner that may tell us something—‘G. D.’
It probably belongs to some guest at Ardsley.
And there’s a very faint suggestion of orris—it’s a city
handkerchief,” said Barbara with finality, “but it has
suffered a trifle in the laundry, as this edge is the least
bit out of drawing from careless ironing.”</p>

<p>“And I should say, from a certain crispness it still
retains, that it hasn’t been in the forest long. It hasn’t
been rained on, at any rate,” added Griswold.</p>

<p>“But even the handkerchief doesn’t tell us anything,”
said Barbara, spreading it out, “except that some woman
visitor has ridden here within a few days and played
drop the handkerchief with herself or somebody else to
us unknown.”</p>

<p>“She may have been a scarlet fever patient from
Ardsley; you’d better have a care!” And Griswold’s
tone was bitter.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid; and as I have never been so near
Ardsley before, I should like to ride in and steal a
glimpse. There’s little danger of meeting the lord of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the manor, I suppose, or any of his guests at this hour,
and we need not go near the house.”</p>

<p>He saw that she was really curious, and it was not in
his heart to refuse her, so they followed the bridle-path
through the cool forest, and came in due course to the
clearing where Jerry had first confessed herself lost, and
thereafter had suffered the captured outlaw to point her
the way home.</p>

<p>“The timber has been cut here since my last visit, but
I remember the bridle-paths very well. They all reach
the highroad of the estate ultimately. We may safely
take this one, which has been the most used, and which
climbs a hill that gives a fine outlook.”</p>

<p>The path he chose had really been beaten into better
condition than either of the others, and they rode side
by side now. A deer feeding on a grassy slope raised its
head and stared at them, and a fox scampered wildly
before them. It seemed that they were shut in from
all the world, these two, who but a few days before had
never seen each other, and it was a relief to him to find
that she threw off her troubles and became more animated
and cheerful than he had yet seen her. His
comments on her mount, which was sorry enough, were
amusing; and she paused now and then to peer into
the tops of the tallest trees, under the pretence that
Appleweight had probably reverted to the primordial
and might be found at any minute in one of the branches
above them. Her dark-green habit, and the soft hat
to match, with its little feather thrust into the side, spoke
for real usage; and the gauntleted hand that swung
lightly at her side inadvertently brushed his own once—and
he knew that this must not happen again! When
their eyes met it was with frank confidence on her part,
and it seemed to him that they were very old friends,
and that they had been riding through this forest, or
one identical with it, since the world began. It is thus
that a man with any imagination feels first about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
woman who begins to interest him—that there was
never any beginning to their acquaintance that can be
reckoned as time and experience are measured, but that
he has known her for countless years; and if there be
a poetic vein in him, he will indulge in such fancies as
that he has seen her as a priestess of Aphrodite in the
long ago, dreaming upon the temple steps; or that he
has watched her skipping pebbles upon the violet storied
sea against a hazy background of cities long crumbled
into dust. Such fancies as these are a part of love’s
gentle madness, and luckier than she knows is the girl
who awakens in a lover this eager idealization. If he
can turn a verse for her in which she is added to the
sacred Nine, personifying all sweet, gentle, and gracious
things, so much the better.</p>

<p>Just what he, on the other hand, may mean to her;
just what form of deification he evokes in her, he can
never know; for the women who write of such matters
have never been those who are sincere or worth heeding,
and they never will be, so long as woman’s heart remains
what it has been from the beginning—far-hidden, and
filled with incommunicable secret beliefs and longings,
and tremulous with fears that are beyond man’s power
to understand.</p>

<p>Griswold had missed the white rose that he had begun
to associate with Barbara, and he grew suddenly daring
and spoke of it.</p>

<p>“You haven’t your rose to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m beyond the source of supply! I have a
young friend, a girl, who makes her living as a florist—not
a purely commercial enterprise, for she experiments
and develops new varieties, and is quite wonderful; and
that white rose is her own creation—it is becoming well
known. She named it for me, and she sends me at least
one every day—she says it’s my royalty—if that’s what
you lawyers call that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“We lawyers rarely have anything so interesting as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
that to apply the word to! So that rose is the Barbara?”
and it gave him a feeling of recklessness to find
himself speaking her name aloud. “There are large
conservatories on the estate, over there somewhere; I
might risk the scarlet fever by attacking the gardener
and demanding a Barbara for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid my little flower hasn’t attained to the
grandeur of Ardsley,” she laughed. “But pray, where
are we?”</p>

<p>They had reached the highroad much sooner than
Griswold had expected, and he checked his horse
abruptly, remembering that he was <i>persona non grata</i>
on this soil.</p>

<p>“We must go back; I mustn’t be seen here. The
workmen are scattered all about the place, and they all
know me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a little farther! I want to see the towers
of the castle!”</p>

<p>If she had asked him to jump into the sea he would
not have hesitated; and he was so happy at being with
her that his heart sang defiance to Ardmore and the
splendours of Ardsley.</p>

<p>They were riding now toward the red bungalow,
where he had often sprawled on the broad benches and
chaffed with Ardmore for hours at a time. Tea was
served here sometimes when there were guests at the
house; and Griswold wondered just who were included
in the party that his quondam friend was entertaining,
and how Mrs. Atchison was progressing in her efforts
to effect a match between Daisy Waters and her
brother.</p>

<p>The drives were nearly all open to the public, so that
by the letter of the law he was no intruder; but beyond
the bungalow he must not go. Sobered by the thought
of his breach with Ardmore, he resolved not to pass the
bungalow whose red roof was now in sight.</p>

<p>“It’s like a fairy place, and I feel that there can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
no end to it,” Barbara was saying. “But it isn’t kind
to urge you in. We certainly are doing nothing to find
Appleweight, and it must be nearly noon.”</p>

<p>It was just then—he vividly recalls the moment—as
Griswold felt in his waistcoat for his watch, that Miss
Jerry Dangerfield, with Thomas Ardmore at her side,
galloped into view. They were racing madly, like irresponsible
children, and bore boisterously down upon the
two pilgrims.</p>

<p>Jerry and Ardmore, hatless and warm, were pardonably
indignant at thus being arrested in their flight, and
the master of Ardsley, feeling for once the dignity of
his proprietorship, broke out stormily.</p>

<p>“I would have you know—I would have you know——”
he roared, and then his voice failed him. He stared;
he spluttered; he busied himself with his horse, which
was dancing in eagerness to resume the race. He quieted
the beast, which nevertheless arched and pawed like a
war-horse, and then the master of Ardsley bawled:</p>

<p>“Grissy! I say, Grissy!”</p>

<p>Miss Osborne and Professor Griswold, on their drooping
Mingo County nondescripts, made a tame picture
before Ardmore and his fair companion on their Ardsley
hunters. The daughter of the governor of South Carolina
looked upon the daughter of the governor of North
Carolina with high disdain, and it need hardly be said
that this feeling, as expressed by glacial glances, was
evenly reciprocal, and that in the contemptuous upward
tilt of two charming chins the nicest judgment would
have been necessary to any fair opinion as to which
state had the better argument.</p>

<p>The associate professor of admiralty was known as a
ready debater, and he quickly returned his former
friend’s salutation, and in much the contumelious tone
he would have used in withering an adversary before a
jury.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but are you one of the employees here?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Why, Grissy, old man, don’t look at me like that!
How did you——”</p>

<p>“I owe your master an apology for riding upon his
property at a time when pestilence is giving you cause
for so much concern. The death-rate from scarlet fever
is deplorably high——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Grissy!” cried Ardmore.</p>

<p>“You have addressed me familiarly, by a nickname
sometimes used by intimate friends, though I can’t for
the life of me recall you. I want you to know that I
am here in an official capacity, on an errand for the
state of South Carolina.”</p>

<p>Miss Dangerfield’s chin, which had dropped a trifle,
pointed again into the blue ether.</p>

<p>“You will pardon me,” she said, “but an agent of
the state of South Carolina is far exceeding his powers
when he intrudes upon North Carolina soil.”</p>

<p>“The state of South Carolina does what it pleases and
goes where it likes,” declared Miss Barbara Osborne
warmly, whereupon Mr. Ardmore, at a glance from his
coadjutor, waxed righteously indignant.</p>

<p>“It’s one thing, sir, for you to ride in here as a sightseer,
but quite another for you to come representing an
unfriendly state. You will please choose which view of
the matter I shall take, and I shall act accordingly.”</p>

<p>Griswold’s companion spoke to him earnestly in a low
tone for a moment, and then Griswold addressed Ardmore
incisively.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you pretend to be, sir; but it may
interest you to know that <i>I</i> am the governor of South
Carolina!”</p>

<p>“And this gentleman,” cried Jerry, pointing to Ardmore
with her riding-crop, “though his hair is mussed
and his scarf visibly untied, is none other than the
governor of North Carolina, and he is not only on his
own property, but in the sovereign state of which he
is the chief executive.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>Professor Griswold lifted his hat with the least flourish.</p>

<p>“I congratulate the state of North Carolina on having
reposed authority in hands so capable. If this young
lady is correct, sir, I will serve official notice on you
that I have reason to believe that a person named Appleweight,
a fugitive from justice, is hiding on your property
and in your state, and I now formally demand that
you surrender him forthwith.”</p>

<p>“If I may introduce myself,” interposed Jerry, “I
will say to you that my name is Geraldine Dangerfield,
and that this Appleweight person is now at Mr. Ardmore’s
house.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” replied Miss Osborne with gentle irony,
“that he has the pink parlour and leads the conversation
at table.”</p>

<p>“You are quite mistaken,” replied Ardmore; “but
if it would afford you any satisfaction to see the outlaw
you may look upon him in my wine cellar, where, only
an hour ago, I left him sitting on a case of Chateau
Bizet ’82. My further intentions touching this scoundrelly
South Carolinian I need not now disclose; but I
give you warning that the Appleweight issue will soon
and for ever be terminated, and in a manner that will
greatly redound to the credit and the glory of the Old
North State.”</p>

<p>Professor Griswold’s hand went to his moustache with
a gesture that smote Ardmore, for he knew that it hid
that inscrutable smile that had always baffled him.</p>

<p>“I trust,” said Griswold, “that the prisoner, whom
we cannot for a moment concede to be the real Appleweight,
will not be exposed to scarlet fever, pending a
settlement of this matter. It is my understanding that
the Bizet ’82 is a fraudulent vintage that has never
been nearer France than Paris, Illinois, and if the
prisoner in your cellar drinks of it I shall hold you
officially responsible for the consequences. And now, I
have the honour to bid you both good-morning.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>He and Barbara swung their horses round and retraced
their way, leaving Ardmore and Jerry gazing after
them.</p>

<p>When the shabby beasts from the stable at Turner
Court House had borne Miss Osborne and Griswold out
of sight beyond the bungalow, Ardmore turned blankly
to Jerry.</p>

<p>“Have I gone blind or anything? Unless I’m crazy
that was dear old Grissy, but who is that girl?”</p>

<p>“That is Miss Barbara Osborne, and I hope she has
learned such a lesson that she will not be snippy to me
any more, if she <i>is</i> the president-general of the Daughters
of the Seminole War.”</p>

<p>“But where do you suppose she found Grissy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure; nor, Mr. Ardmore, do I
care.”</p>

<p>“He said he represented the state of South Carolina—do
you suppose the governor has really employed him?”</p>

<p>“I do not,” said Jerry emphatically; “for he appears
intelligent, and intelligence is something that would
never appeal to Governor Osborne. It is quite possible,”
mused Jerry aloud, “that Miss Osborne’s father had disappeared
like mine, and that she is running his office
with Mr. Griswold’s aid. If so, we shall probably have
some fun before we get through with this.”</p>

<p>“If that’s true we shall have more than fun!” exclaimed
Ardmore, thoroughly aroused. “You don’t
know Grissy. He’s the smartest man alive, and if he’s
running this Appleweight case for Governor Osborne,
he’ll keep us guessing. Why did I ever send him that
scarlet fever telegram, anyhow? He’ll fight harder than
ever for that, and all I wanted was to keep him away
until we had got all through with this business here, so
I could show him what a great man I had been, and
how I had been equal to an opportunity when it offered.”</p>

<p>“I wish you to remember, Mr. Ardmore, that you still
have <i>your</i> opportunity, and that I expect you to carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
this matter through to a safe conclusion and to the
honour of the Old North State.”</p>

<p>“I have no intention of failing, Miss Dangerfield;”
and with this they turned and rode slowly back toward
the house.</p>

<p>Professor Griswold and Miss Osborne were silent until
the forest again shut them in.</p>

<p>Then, in a sequestered spot, Griswold suddenly threw
up his head and laughed long and loud.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t strike me as being so amusing,” remarked
Miss Osborne. “They have Appleweight in their wine
cellar, and I don’t see for the life of me how we are
going to get him out.”</p>

<p>“What’s funny, Miss Osborne, is Ardy—that he and
I should be pitted against each other in a thing of this
kind is too utterly ridiculous. Ardy acting as governor
of North Carolina beats anything that ever happened
on this continent. But how do you suppose he ever
met Miss Dangerfield, who certainly is a self-contained
young woman?”</p>

<p>“The answer to that riddle is so simple,” replied Miss
Osborne, “that I am amazed that you fail to see it for
yourself. Miss Dangerfield is undoubtedly the girl with
the winking eye.”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” protested Griswold.</p>

<p>“I don’t hesitate to announce that as a fact. Miss
Geraldine Dangerfield, beyond any question, is the
young lady whom Mr. Ardmore, your knight-errant
friend, went forth for to seek. Just how they met we
shall perhaps learn later on. But just now it seems
rather necessary for us to adopt some plan of action,
unless you feel that you do not wish to oppose your
friend.”</p>

<p>“Oppose him! I have got to whip him to the dust
if I shake down the very towers of his stronghold! It’s
well we have the militia on the road. With the state
army at our back we can show Tommy Ardmore a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
things in state administration that are not dreamed of
in his philosophy.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they really have Appleweight?”
asked Barbara.</p>

<p>“Not for a minute! They told us that story merely
to annoy us when they found what we were looking for.
That touch about the wine cellar is characteristically
Ardmoresque. If they had Appleweight you may be
sure they wouldn’t keep him on the premises.”</p>

<p>Whereupon they rode back to Turner Court House
much faster than they had come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br />


<small>THE PRISONER IN THE CORN-CRIB.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> and Ardmore sat at a long table in the commodious
Ardsley library, which was a modification of a
Gothic chapel. It was on the upper floor, with broad
windows that had the effect of bringing the landscape
indoors, and the North Carolina sky is, we must concede,
a pleasant thing to have at one’s elbow. A large
accumulation of mail from the governor’s office at
Raleigh had been forwarded, and Jerry insisted that it
must be opened and disposed of in some way. Governor
Dangerfield was, it appeared, a subscriber to a clipping
bureau, and they had been examining critically a batch
of cuttings relating to the New Orleans incident. Most
of them were in a frivolous key, playfully reviving the
ancient query as to what the governor of North Carolina
really said to the governor of South Carolina. Others
sought causes for the widely-reported disappearance of
the two governors; and still other reports boldly maintained
that Governors Dangerfield and Osborne were at
their capitals engaged in the duties of their respective
offices.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing we got hold of Collins,” observed
Ardmore, putting down a clipping from a New York
paper in which the reports of Governor Dangerfield’s
disappearance were analyzed and tersely dismissed;
“for he knows how to write, and he’s done a splendid
picture of your father on his throne attending to business;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and his little stingers for Osborne are the work
of genius.”</p>

<p>“There’s a certain finish about Mr. Collins’s lying
that is refreshing,” replied Jerry, “and I cannot help
thinking that he has a brilliant future before him if
he enters politics. Nothing pains me more than a careless,
ill-considered, silly lie, which is the best that most
people can do. But it would be very interesting to
know whether Governor Osborne has really disappeared,
or just how your friend the Virginia professor has seized
the reins of state. Do you suppose he got a jug from
somewhere, and met Miss Osborne and——”</p>

<p>“Do you think—do you think—she may have—er—possibly—closed
one eye in his direction?” asked Ardmore
dubiously.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore”—and Jerry pointed at him with a
bronze paper-cutter to make sure of his attention—“Mr.
Ardmore, if you ever imply again by act, word, or
deed that I winked at you I shall never, never speak
to you again. I should think that a man with a nice
sister like Mrs. Atchison would have a better opinion
of women than you seem to have. I never saw you
until you came to my father’s house to tell me about
the jug—and you know I didn’t. And as for that Barbara
Osborne, while I don’t doubt that even in South
Carolina a Daughter of the Seminole War might wink
at a gentleman in a moment of extreme provocation, I
doubt if she did, for she lacks animation, and has no
more soul than a gum overshoe.”</p>

<p>The obvious inconsistency of this pronouncement
caused Ardmore to frown in the stress of his thought;
and he stared helplessly along the line of the accusing
paper-cutter into Jerry’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, cheer up!” she cried in her despair of him;
“and forget it, forget it, forget it! I’ll say this to you,
Mr. Ardmore, that if I ever winked at you—and I never,
never did—I’m sorry I did it! Some time when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
haven’t so much work on your hands as you have this
morning just think that over and let me know where
you land. And now, look at these things, please.”</p>

<p>“What is all this stuff?” he demanded, as she tossed
him a pile of papers.</p>

<p>“They refer to the application for pardon of a poor
man who’s going to be hanged for murder to-morrow
unless we do something for him; and he has a wife and
three little children, and he has never committed any
other crime but to break into a smoke-house and steal
a side of bacon.”</p>

<p>“Did he shoot in self-defence, or how was it?” asked
Ardmore judicially.</p>

<p>“He killed a painless dentist who pulled the wrong
tooth,” answered Jerry, referring to the papers.</p>

<p>“If that’s all I don’t think we can stand for hanging
him. I read a piece against capital punishment in a
magazine once, and the arguments were very strong.
The killing of a dentist should not be a crime anyhow,
and if you know how to pardon a man, why let’s do
it; but we’d better wait until the last minute, and
then send a telegram to the sheriff to stop the proceedings
just before he pulls the string, which makes it most
impressive, and gives a better effect.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right about it,” said Jerry. “There’s
an old pardon right here in this bundle which we can
use. It was made out for another man who stole a
horse that afterwards died, which papa said was a mitigating
circumstance; but the week before his execution
the man escaped from jail before papa could pardon
him.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we don’t let them hang anybody while
we’re running the state,” suggested Ardmore; “it’s
almost as though you murdered a man yourself, and I
couldn’t tie my neckties afterwards without a guilty
feeling. I can’t imagine anything more disagreeable
than to be hanged. I heard all of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
once, and I have seen half an Ibsen play, and those
were hard things to bear, but I suppose hanging would
be just as painful, and there would be no supper afterwards
to cheer you up.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t speak in that tone of <i>Afterwards</i>, Mr.
Ardmore,” said Jerry severely. “It isn’t religious.
And while we’re on the subject of religion, may I ask
the really, truly wherefore of Miss Daisy Waters’s sudden
return to Newport?” and Jerry’s tone and manner were
carelessly demure.</p>

<p>“She went home,” replied Ardmore, grinning; “she
left Ardsley for two reasons, one of which she stated
at the breakfast-table and the other she handed me
privately.”</p>

<p>“She said at the breakfast-table that she was called
home by incipient whooping-cough in the household of
her brother-in-law’s cousin’s family.”</p>

<p>“As she has no brother-in-law, that cannot be true.
What she said to me privately was that the house party
had grown very much larger than Mrs. Atchison had
originally planned it, and that I am so busy that so
many guests must be a burden.”</p>

<p>Jerry stroked her cheek reflectively.</p>

<p>“I thought Miss Waters wouldn’t last long after I
asked her if rusty-nail water really would remove freckles.
My own freckles are exactly seven in number, and I am
not ashamed of them; but Miss Waters seemed very
sensitive on the subject, though I thought her freckles
useful in diverting attention from her drug-store hair.”</p>

<p>“Did you say seven?” inquired Ardmore, gazing
eagerly into Jerry’s face. “I make it only six, and
there’s one away over there under your left eye that seems
very lonesome, as though it suffered keenly from being
so far away from its brothers and sisters on the other
side of your nose.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore”—and Jerry again indicated the person
addressed by pointing with the paper-cutter—“Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Ardmore, it is downright impudent of you to talk to me
about my appearance in any terms, but when you speak
of my face as though it were a map in a geography and
of my freckles as though they were county seats, or
lakes, or strange places in China, then I must protest
with all my strength. If you don’t change the subject
immediately I shall refuse to pardon this person who
killed the painless dentist, and he shall be hanged by
the neck till he be dead; and you, Mr. Thomas Ardmore,
will be guilty of his murder.”</p>

<p>The discussion of Miss Jerry Dangerfield’s freckles
ceased abruptly on the appearance of Big Paul, the
forester.</p>

<p>“A body of South Carolina militia is marching across
country from the south. One of my men heard of it
down at Turner Court House last night, and rode to
where the troops were encamped. He learned that it
was a practice march for the militia. There’s several
companies of infantry, so he reports, and a piece of
artillery.”</p>

<p>“Bully for old Grissy!” exclaimed Ardmore. “They’re
coming this way, are they, Paul?” And the three bent
over the map.</p>

<p>“That is the place, sir. They seem to be planning to
get around Turner’s without stirring up the town. But
it would take a good deal to wake up Turner’s,” laughed
the big German.</p>

<p>Jerry placed her finger on the state line.</p>

<p>“If they dare cross that—if they as much as dare!”</p>

<p>“If they dare we shall show them a few things.—Take
all the men you need, Paul, to watch their movements.
That will do.”</p>

<p>The forester lingered.</p>

<p>“You remember that we spoke the other day of the
log house on Raccoon Creek, where the Appleweights had
driven off our man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Paul. It is where the state line crosses the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
heavy woods and the farthest outpost, so to speak, on
my property. When you cross the little creek, you’re
in South Carolina. You said some of these Appleweight
fellows had been cutting off the timber down there, if
I remember rightly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the forester, twirling his cap
awkwardly. “But some of the people on the estate
have said——”</p>

<p>He broke off in an embarrassment so unlike him that
Jerry and Ardmore looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>“Well, Paul, what’s the matter? If the cabin has
been burned down it’s no serious matter.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir; some of the men passing there at night
say they see lights and hear sounds in the cabin, though
no one from the estate goes there. A child died in the
house last spring, and—well, you know how some of
these people are!”</p>

<p>“Ghosts!” cried Ardmore. “The property is growing
more valuable all the time! Tell them that whoever
captures the ghost and brings it here shall have a handsome
present. So far it’s only a light in an abandoned
house—is that it?”</p>

<p>“Well, they say it’s very strange,” and it was clear
that the German was not wholly satisfied to have his
employer laugh off the story.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Paul. We have bigger business on hand
than the chasing of ghosts just now. When we get
through with these other things I’ll go over there myself
and take a look at the spook.”</p>

<p>As Paul hurried away, Jerry seized a pen and wrote
this message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Rutherford Gillingwater,<br />
<span class="indentleft5">Adjutant-General, Camp Dangerfield,</span><br />
<span class="indentleft6">Azbell, N. C.:</span></p>

<p>Move all available troops by shortest route to Kildare at once and
report to me personally at Ardsley. Make no statements to newspapers.
Answer.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Dangerfield</span>, &#160; &#160; <br />
Governor.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“I guess that will bring him running,” said Ardmore,
calling a servant and ordering the message despatched
immediately. “But when he comes, expecting to report
to the governor and finds that he isn’t here, what do
you suppose he will do?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore,” began Jerry, in the tone of sweet
tolerance with which one arraigns a hopeless child—“Mr.
Ardmore, there are times when you tax my patience
severely. You don’t seem to grasp the idea that we
are not making explanations to inferiors in our administration.
Colonel Gillingwater will undoubtedly be
a good deal surprised to get that message, but when the
first shock is over he will obey the orders of his commander-in-chief.
And the fact that he is ordered to
report to Ardsley will not be lost on him, for he will see
in that a possible social opportunity, and a chance to
wear some of his uniforms that he has never worn before.
He will think that papa is really here to test the efficiency
of the troops, and that as papa is a guest at Ardsley,
which we know he isn’t, there will probably be some
great social functions in this house, with papa’s staff
dressed up and all shiny in gold braid. Since Rutherford
Gillingwater had the typhoid fever during the Spanish
War I have not been sure that he is as much interested
in fighting as he is in the purely circus work of being a
soldier. I just now recall that when papa was about
to order out the troops to stop a railroad strike last
spring, Rutherford Gillingwater went to all the trouble
of having tonsilitis, and was so ill that he could hardly
leave his room even after the strike had been settled
by arbitration. If he knew that there was likely to
be a terrible battle over here instead of nice long
dinners and toasts to ‘The Old North State,’ ‘Our
Governor,’ and ‘The Governor’s Daughter,’ his old
wounds, that he never had, might trouble him so that
they’d have to wrap him up in cotton and carry him
home.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Before luncheon a message was received from Gillingwater,
to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Governor William Dangerfield.<br />
<span class="indentleft7">Ardsley, N. C.:</span></p>

<p>En route with our entire available force in the field. I am riding
ahead with all speed, and will report at Ardsley at nine o’clock. Is
full military dress <i>de rigueur</i>?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Gillingwater</span>, Adjutant-General.</p>
</div>

<p>“Isn’t that just like Rutherford! He’s afraid he
won’t be dressy enough; but if he knew that the South
Carolina troops might shoot holes in his uniform he
wouldn’t be due here for a couple of weeks, instead of
at nine o’clock to-night;” and Jerry laughed merrily.</p>

<p>They debated more seriously this telegram from Collins
at Raleigh sent the previous evening:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Can’t maintain this bluff much longer. Even the friendly newspapers
are growing suspicious. State credit jeopardized by disappearance
of Treasurer Foster. Billings, of Bronx Loan and Trust, here
in a great fury over bond matter. Do you know governor’s whereabouts?</p>
</div>

<p>“Things are certainly growing more exciting,” was
Ardmore’s comment. “I suppose even a gifted liar like
Collins can’t muzzle the press for ever.”</p>

<p>“You can’t go on fooling all North Carolina all the
time, either,” said Jerry, “and I suppose when papa
gets tired of being scared he will turn up in Raleigh and
tell some plausible story about where he has been and
what has happened. When it comes to being plausible
no one can touch papa.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s dead,” suggested Ardmore gloomily.</p>

<p>“That’s a real inspiration on your part, Mr. Ardmore;
and it’s very sweet of you to mention it, but I have no
idea that any harm has come to papa. It’s too much
trouble to get elected governor, without dying in office,
and besides, papa is none too friendly with the lieutenant-governor,
and would never think of allowing such
a person to succeed him. But those bonds seem rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
serious, and I don’t like the idea of your Mr. Billings
making a fuss at Raleigh.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right,” remarked Ardmore, blotting
the last of a number of telegrams which he had been
writing, and pressing a button. “It’s much more important
for us to get Appleweight into a South Carolina
jail; and it’s not going to be so easy to do, now that
Grissy is working on the other side, and angry at me
about that scarlet fever telegram.</p>

<p>“There may be trouble,” said Ardmore to his guests
as they sat at luncheon. “But I should hate to have it
said that my guests could not be taken care of here
perfectly. I beg that you will all remain.”</p>

<p>“If there’s to be a row, why don’t you call the police
and be done with it?” asked a sad young member of
the company. His motor number had so often figured
in reports of speed law violations that he was known as
Eighteen Eighty. “I thought you came down here for
quiet and not to get into trouble, Ardy.”</p>

<p>“If I miss my steamer nine days from to-day, and
meanwhile have to eat horse meat, just as they did in
the siege of Paris, I shall be greatly provoked, to say
the least,” remarked Mrs. Atchison pleasantly; for her
brother’s amazing awakening delighted her, and it was
a cheering experience that he promised, of civil war,
battle, murder, and sudden death.</p>

<p>“I think I shall spend more time in America after
this,” remarked Eighteen Eighty. “I did not know
that amusing things ever happened over here. What did
you say the name of this state is?”</p>

<p>“The name of this state,” replied Miss Dangerfield,
“is North Carolina, and I have my opinion of any
native American who runs around Europe all the time,
and who can visit a place in this country without even
knowing the name of the state he is in.”</p>

<p>“But there’s really no difference between North and
South Carolina, is there?” persisted Eighteen Eighty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>Jerry put down her fork, and folded her hands beside
her plate, while she addressed the offender.</p>

<p>“Mr. Number Something, the difference between the
Old North State and South Carolina is not merely geographical—it
is also intellectual, ethical, and spiritual.
But may I ask you whether you know of which state
you are a citizen?”</p>

<p>A laugh rose as the sad young man flushed and looked
inquiringly about.</p>

<p>“I voted you in my precinct that time I ran for alderman
in New York,” said Ardmore, “but that’s no sign
you had a right to vote there. I shot Ballywinkle
through the booth at the same time. I was a reform
candidate and needed votes, but I hoped Bally would
get arrested and be sent to jail. My impression is that
you are really a citizen of Rhode Island, which is where
Newport is.”</p>

<p>The debate as to Eighteen Eighty’s legal residence was
interrupted by the arrival of a summons for Ardmore,
who hurriedly left the table.</p>

<p>Big Paul awaited him below, mounted and holding a
led-horse.</p>

<p>“There’s a line of the South Carolina militia crawling
through the woods toward Raccoon Creek. They insist
that it’s a practice skirmish, and that they’ve come
over here because the landscape is naturally adapted to
their purposes.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully nice of them to like my scenery. You’d
better send your best man out to meet Colonel Gillingwater
of the North Carolina militia, and tell him to
march all his troops into the estate by the north gates,
and to be in a hurry. Tell him—tell him Governor
Dangerfield is anxious to have the staff present in full
uniform at a grand ball at Ardsley to-night.”</p>

<p>Ardmore rode off alone toward Raccoon Creek to
catch a view of the enemy. How far would Griswold
go? This question he kept debating with himself. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
late friend was a lawyer and a serious one whom he
had not believed capable of seizing the militia of one
state and using it to make a military demonstration
against another. Ardmore could go as far as Griswold;
yet he was puzzled to know why Griswold was in the
field at all. Miss Dangerfield’s suggestion that Griswold’s
interest in the daughter of the governor of South
Carolina accounted for his presence on the border seemed
plausible at first; and yet the more he thought about
it the less credible it seemed, for he was sure that Griswold
had talked to him about women with the frankness
that had characterized all their intercourse, and
Ardmore racked his brains in his effort to recall the
few affairs to which the associate professor of admiralty
had pleaded guilty. Memory brought these back
to him slowly. There was an Old Point Comfort affair,
dating back to Griswold’s student days, and to which
he had referred with no little feeling once or twice;
and there was a York Harbour affair, that came a little
later; and there was the girl he had met on a steamer,
about whom Griswold had shown sensitiveness when
Ardmore had made bold to twit him. But Ardmore
could not account for Miss Osborne, unless his friend
had been withholding his confidence while seemingly
wholly frank; and the thought that this must be true
widened the breach between them. And when he was
saying to himself that the daughters of governors are
not in the habit of picking up cavaliers and entrusting
state affairs to them, and that it was almost inconceivable
that the conscientious Griswold, at the busiest
season at the university, should have taken employment
from the governor of South Carolina, he found
that he had struck a stone wall, and he confessed to
himself that the situation was beyond him.</p>

<p>These reflections carried him far toward Raccoon
Creek, and when he had reached that tortuous stream
he dismounted and tied his horse, the more freely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
examine the frontier. The Raccoon is never more than
eighty feet wide, but filled with boulders round which
the water foams in many curves and splashes, running
away in the merriest ripples, so that it is never wholly
tranquil. By jumping from boulder to boulder he
crossed the turbulent tide and gained the other side
with a sense of entering the enemy’s country.</p>

<p>“Now,” he muttered, “I am in South Carolina.”</p>

<p>He drew out his map and held it against a tree the
better to study it, reassuring himself that his own
property line embraced several sections of the forest on
the south side of the state boundary.</p>

<p>“If Grissy shoots me, it will be on my own land,”
he said aloud.</p>

<p>He cautiously followed the stream until, several hundred
yards farther on, and overhanging the creek, he
came upon the log cabin in which big Paul had reported
the presence of a ghost. Paul’s story had not interested
him particularly, but now that he was in the neighbourhood
he resolved to visit the cabin and learn if possible
how ghosts amuse themselves by day. He had thrust a
revolver into his pocket before leaving the house, and
while he had no idea that ghosts may be shot, he now
made sure that the weapon was in good order. As he
sat on a log slipping the cylinder through his fingers he
heard whistling farther along the creek, followed quickly
by the snapping of twigs under a heavy tread, and a
moment later a tall, slender man broke into view.</p>

<p>The stranger was dressed like a countryman, but he
was unmistakably not of the Ardsley force of workmen,
for these wore a rough sort of uniform. His hands were
thrust carelessly into the side pockets of a gray jeans
coat. They were thrust in deep, so that the coat sagged
at the pockets. His trousers were turned up from a
pair of rough shoes, and he wore a gray flannel shirt,
the collar of which was guiltless of a tie. He was
smooth shaven, and carried in his mouth a short pipe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
which he paused to relight when about a dozen yards
from Ardmore. Then, as he held the lighted match
above the pipe bowl for an instant to make sure his
tobacco was burning, Ardmore jumped up and covered
him with the pistol.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said the master of Ardsley,
“but you’re my prisoner!”</p>

<p>The stranger shook the flame out of the match-stick
carefully and threw it away before turning toward his
captor.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said with perfect self-possession,
“don’t fool with that gun; it might go off.”</p>

<p>His drawl was characteristic of the region; his tone
was one of amused tolerance. Ardmore was short of
stature, and his knickerbockers, leggings, and Norfolk
jacket were not wholly consonant with the revolver,
which, however, he levelled very steadily at the stranger’s
head.</p>

<p>“You are an intruder on my property,” said the
master of Ardsley, “and unless I’m much mistaken you
have been playing ghost in that cabin. I’ve heard
about you. Your gang has been cutting off my timber
about long enough, and this game of playing ghost to
scare my men won’t do.”</p>

<p>“Stealing your timber?” And the stranger was
clearly surprised. He held his pipe in his hand with
his thumb over the bowl and seemed to take a more
serious interest in his captor.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued Ardmore, “I’m about tired of
having this end of the country run by the Appleweights,
and their disreputable gang, so I’m going to lock you
up.”</p>

<p>The stranger turned toward the cabin, one corner of
which was plainly visible, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to do with the Appleweights, and I
assure you I am not a timber thief.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be the one who has lifted a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
steers out of my herd. It makes no difference just what
branch of the business you are engaged in, for we’re
picking up all the gang and you’ve got to come along
with me.”</p>

<p>The captive showed signs of anger for the first time.
His face flushed, and he took a step toward Ardmore,
who immediately threw up the revolver so that it
pointed at the man’s head.</p>

<p>“Stop right there! We’ve got old man Appleweight,
so you’ve lost your leader, and I tell you the jig’s up.
We’ll have you all in jail before another twenty-four
hours has passed.”</p>

<p>“I judge from the tone of your remarks that you are
Ardmore, the owner of Ardsley. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“You are quite right. And you are a member of a
disreputable gang of outlaws that has been bringing
shame upon the state of North Carolina. Now, I
want you to march straight ahead of me. Step lively
now!” And Ardmore flourished the pistol menacingly.
“March!”</p>

<p>The man hesitated, flung up his head defiantly, then
moved slowly forward. The flush in his face had deepened
and his eyes flashed angrily; but Ardmore, his cap
on the back of his head, himself presented a figure so
severe, so eloquent of righteous indignation, that the
stranger tamely obeyed him.</p>

<p>“We will cross the creek right here,” he ordered;
“it’s a pretty jump there from that boulder—there,
that was bully! Now right along there over the log—see
the trail! Good!”</p>

<p>It was warm and the captive was perspiring freely.
He moved along docilely, and finding that he manifested
no inclination to bolt, Ardmore dropped the revolver to
his side, but with his finger on the trigger. He was very
proud of himself; for while to Miss Jerry Dangerfield
undoubtedly belonged the honour of capturing the thief
Appleweight, yet he had single-handed arrested a member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of the famous gang, and he had already resolved
upon a convenient method of disposing of his prisoner.
They paused while Ardmore mounted his horse, silencing
the captive, who took the opportunity to break out
protestingly against what he termed an infamous outrage
upon personal liberty.</p>

<p>“You’ve taken me from one state into another without
due process of law,” declared the stranger, thinking
to impress Ardmore, as that young gentleman settled
himself in his saddle.</p>

<p>“Go right on now; that’s a good fellow,” replied the
master of Ardsley, lifting the revolver warningly.
“Whether it’s North Carolina or South Dakota—it
doesn’t make a particle of difference to me. As I remarked
before, it’s my property, I tell you, and I do
what I please here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you whether you do or not,” snorted the
prisoner, who was trudging along doggedly with the nose
of Ardmore’s horse occasionally poking his back.</p>

<p>They soon reached a field where some labourers were
at work, and Ardmore called them to him for instructions.</p>

<p>“Boys, this is one of the timber thieves; put him in
that corn-crib until I come back for him. The nights
are warm; the sky is perfectly clear; and you will
kindly see that he does not lack for food.”</p>

<p>Two of the men jumped forward and seized Ardmore’s
prisoner, who now broke forth in a torrent of
wrath, struggling vigorously in the hands of the sturdy
fellows who had laid violent hands on him.</p>

<p>“That’s right, boys; that’s right; easy there! Now
in he goes.”</p>

<p>A series of corn-cribs fringed the field, and into one
of these, from which half the corn had been removed,
the prisoner was thrust sprawling upon the yellow ears,
and when he rose and flung himself round, the door of
the corn-crib slammed in his face. He bellowed with
rage now, seeing that his imprisonment was a serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
matter, and that it seemed likely to be prolonged indefinitely.</p>

<p>“They always told me you were a fool,” he howled,
“but I didn’t know that anything as crazy as you are
was loose in the world.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. The head of your gang is much more
polite. He’s sitting on his case of Chateau Bizet in my
wine cellar, playing solitaire.”</p>

<p>“Appleweight in your wine cellar!” bawled the captive
in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I was afraid to lock him in a room with
bath for fear it might give him hydrophobia; but he’s
perfectly content in the wine cellar.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with him?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t decided yet just what to do with him, but
the scoundrel undoubtedly belongs in South Carolina,
and I have every intention of making his own state
punish him.”</p>

<p>The prisoner leaned heavily against his prison door,
and glared out upon his jailer with a new, fierce interest.</p>

<p>“I tell you I’ve nothing to do with the Appleweights!
I don’t want to reveal my identity to you, you young
beggar; but I demand my legal rights.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” retorted Ardmore, “you have no
legal rights, for the writ of habeas corpus doesn’t go
here. You seem rather intelligent for a barn burner
and timber thief. Come now, what is your name?”</p>

<p>The prisoner gazed down upon the imperturbable
figure of his captor through the slats of the corn-crib.
Ardmore returned his gaze with his most bland and
child-like air. Many people had been driven to the
point of madness by Ardmore’s apparent dullness. The
prisoner realized that he must launch a thunderbolt if
he would disturb a self-possession so complete—a tranquillity
as sweet as the fading afternoon.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore, I dislike to do it, but your amazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
conduct makes it necessary for me to disclose my identity,”
and the man’s manner showed real embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I knew it; I knew it,” nodded Ardmore, folding his
arms across his chest. “You’re either the King of Siam
or the Prince of Petosky. As either, I salute you!”</p>

<p>“No!” roared the captive, beating impotently against
the door of the cage with his hands. “No! I’m the
governor of South Carolina!”</p>

<p>This statement failed, however, to produce the slightest
effect on Mr. Ardmore, who only smiled slightly, a
smile less incredulous than disdainful.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! that’s nothing,” he replied; “<i>I’m</i> the
governor of North Carolina!” and mounting his horse
he gravely lifted his hat to the prisoner and galloped
away.</p>

<p>While Mr. Ardmore was securing his prisoner in the
corn-crib it may be interesting to return for a moment to
the haunted log cabin on Raccoon Creek, the interior of
which was roughly but comfortably furnished. Above
were two small sleeping-rooms, and beside the bed in
each stood a suit-case and a hand-satchel. In each room
hung, on convenient hooks, a long, black frock-coat, a
pair of trousers of light cloth, and a broad-brim black
felt hat. Coat, trousers, and hat were exactly alike.</p>

<p>In the room below sat a man in his shirt-sleeves, his
feet on a cheap deal table, blowing rings from a cigar.
He presented a picture of the greatest ease and contentment,
as he occasionally stroked his short brown
beard, or threw up his arms and clasped his hands about
his head or caught, lazily at the smoke rings. On the
table lay an array of playing cards and poker chips.</p>

<p>“It’s too good to last for ever,” the lone occupant
reflected aloud, stifling a yawn, and he reached out,
with careless indifference, toward a bundle of newspapers
tied together with a piece of twine, and drew one
out and spread it across his knees. He yawned again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
as though the thought of a world whose affairs were
stamped in printer’s ink bored him immensely; and
then the bold headlines that shouted at him across half
a quarter of the sheet caused him to gasp, and his feet
struck the bare floor of the cabin resoundingly. He now
bent over the paper with the greatest eagerness, muttering
as he read, and some of his mutterings were, it
must be confessed, not without profane embellishment.</p>

<p class="center">TWO COWARDLY GOVERNORS MISSING<br />

<span class="smcap">Scandal Affecting Two State Executives</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Is the Appleweight Case Responsible?</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Rumours of Fatal Duel on State Line</span></p>

<p>He read breathlessly the startling story that followed
the headlines, then rose and glanced anxiously at his
watch.</p>

<p>“Am I drunk or mad? I must find Osborne and get
out of this.”</p>

<p>He leaped to the open door, and gazed into the forest
from a little platform that commanded all sides of the
cabin. And there, to his utter amazement, he saw men
in khaki emerging cautiously from the woods. They
were unmistakably soldiers of some sort, for an officer
was giving sharp commands, and the line opened out
like a fan along the creek. The observer of this manœuvre
mopped his head with his handkerchief as he
watched the alert movements of the figures in khaki.</p>

<p>He was so absorbed that he failed to hear stealthy
steps at the rear of the platform, but he was now rudely
aroused by two uniformed youngsters with S. C. N. G.
on their caps, who sprang upon him and bore him with
a crash to the puncheon floor.</p>

<p>“You’re our prisoner!” shouted one of them, rising
when he found that the prisoner yielded without resistance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“What for?” blurted the captive, sitting up and
rubbing his elbow.</p>

<p>“For being Bill Appleweight, <i>alias</i> Poteet. Get up,
now, and come with us to headquarters, or my instructions
are to break your head.”</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you?” panted the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s anything to you, we’re the South Carolina
militia, so you’d better get up and climb.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br />


<small>THE FLIGHT OF GILLINGWATER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> will be better for me to break the news to Colonel
Gillingwater,” said Jerry, “and you must go out and
meet the troops yourself, with Mr. Cooke and that amusing
Mr. Collins. There is no telling what effect my
tidings will have on Rutherford, or what he will decide
to do. He has never before been so near trouble as he is
now, and I may have to give him first aid to the injured
when he finds out that the South Carolina troops are on
Raccoon Creek, all ready to march upon our sacred soil.”</p>

<p>“But suppose your adjutant-general shouldn’t go back
to his troops after he sees you, then what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t see him by ten o’clock you will take
personal command and exercise your own discretion as
to the best method of landing Appleweight in a South
Carolina jail. After that we must find papa, and it will
be up to him to satisfy the newspapers and his constituents
with some excuse for his strange disappearance.”</p>

<p>Collins had come from Raleigh on the evening train,
and he had solemnly assured Ardmore that the present
state of affairs could not be maintained another twenty-four
hours. He had exhausted his professional resources,
and the North Carolina newspapers of all shades
of opinion were clamouring for the truth, and were
insisting that, for the honour and dignity of the state,
Governor Dangerfield should show himself in Raleigh.
Even the metropolitan press, which Collins had filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
for several days with blithe stories of the administration’s
vigorous policy in the Appleweight case, had
refused further matter from him.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to find Dangerfield or bust. Now, where
is that eminent statesman, Ardmore? You can’t tell
me you don’t know; but if you don’t, Miss Dangerfield
does, and she’s got to tell.”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t the slightest idea, but if the newspapers
find out that he’s really and truly missing, he will have
to show up; but first we’ve got to take Appleweight off
that case of Chateau Bizet and lodge him in the jail at
Turner Court House, and let Governor Osborne have the
odium of incarcerating the big chief of the border, to
whom he is under the greatest political obligations.”</p>

<p>“But it’s all over the country now that Osborne hasn’t
been seen in Columbia since he and Dangerfield had that
row in New Orleans. Cranks are turning up everywhere,
pretending to be governors of various states,
and old Dangerfield is seen on all the outgoing steamers.
There’s been nothing like it since the kidnapping of
Charley Ross.”</p>

<p>Ardmore drew on his riding-gloves reflectively, and a
delighted grin illuminated his countenance.</p>

<p>“I caught a lunatic down on the Raccoon this afternoon
who said <i>he</i> was the governor of South Carolina,
and I locked him up.”</p>

<p>“Well, he may be Osborne,” remarked Collins, with
journalistic suspicion.</p>

<p>“And he may be a Swiss admiral or the king of Mars.
I guess I’m a governor myself, and I know what a
governor looks like and acts like—you can’t fool me. I
put this impostor where he’ll have a chance to study
astronomy to-night.”</p>

<p>“Then he isn’t on that case of Chateau Bizet with
Appleweight?”</p>

<p>“No; I locked him up in a corn-crib until I get time
to study his credentials. Come along now!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Ardmore, Collins, and Cooke rode rapidly away through
the wide gates of the estate along the Sapphire road,
over which, by his last bulletin, the adjutant-general
of North Carolina was marching his troops. They had
left Cooke’s men with Paul’s foresters to guard the
house and to picket the banks of the Raccoon in the
immediate neighbourhood of the camp of the South
Carolinians.</p>

<p>“I guess those fellows can hold ’em till morning,”
said Cooke. “We’ve got to clean up the whole business
by to-morrow night. You can’t have two states at war
with each other this way without shaking up the universe,
and if federal troops come down here to straighten
things out it won’t be funny.”</p>

<p>They had ridden about a mile, when Cooke checked
his horse with an exclamation.</p>

<p>“There’s somebody coming like the devil was after
him. It must be Gillingwater.”</p>

<p>They drew rein and waited, the quick patter of hoofs
ringing out sharply in the still night. The moonlight
gave them a fair sweep of the road, and they at once saw
a horseman galloping rapidly toward them.</p>

<p>“Lordy, the man’s on fire!” gasped Ardmore.</p>

<p>“By George, you’re right!” muttered Collins, moving
nervously in his saddle. “It’s a human sunburst.”</p>

<p>“It’s only his gold braid,” explained the practical
Cooke.</p>

<p>“He must have on solid gold armour, then,” declared
Collins.</p>

<p>Seeing three men drawn across the road, the horseman
began to check his flight.</p>

<p>“Men!” he shouted, as his horse pawed the air with
its forefeet, “is this the road to Ardsley?”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” yelled Cooke, and they were aware
of a flash, a glitter that startled and dazzled the eye,
and Colonel Rutherford Gillingwater thundered on.</p>

<p>Ardmore looked at his watch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“He’s undoubtedly a man of action, if I ever saw one;
and I think we are to be congratulated on having so
gallant a commander for our troops,” said the master
of Ardsley; but the sight of Rutherford Gillingwater
had filled his soul with jealous forebodings. He had
heard that women are prone to fall in worship before
warriors in their battle armour, and he was sure that
Jerry Dangerfield was a girl of infinitely kind heart,
who might not, when face to face with the issue, subject
the man she had engaged to marry to any severe
test.</p>

<p>They rode on, however, and saw presently the lights
of camp-fires, and a little later were ceremoniously
halted at the roadside by an armed guard.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that Collins, who had once been
a second lieutenant in the Georgia militia, should be
presented as an officer of the regular army, detailed as
special aide to Governor Dangerfield during the encampment,
and that in case Gillingwater failed to return
promptly he should take command of the North Carolina
forces.</p>

<p>An open field had been seized for the night’s camp,
and the tents already shone white in the moonlight.
The three men introduced themselves to the militia
officers, and Collins expressed their regret that they had
missed the adjutant-general.</p>

<p>“Governor Dangerfield wished you to move your force
on to Ardsley should we fail to meet Colonel Gillingwater;
and you had better strike your tents and be in
readiness to advance in case he doesn’t personally return
with orders.”</p>

<p>Captain Collins, as he had designated himself, apologized
for not being in uniform.</p>

<p>“I lost my baggage train,” he laughed, “and Governor
Dangerfield is so anxious not to miss this opportunity
to settle the Appleweight case that I hurried out to meet
you with these gentlemen.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Appleweight!” exclaimed the group of officers in
amazement.</p>

<p>“None other than the great Appleweight!” responded
Collins. “The governor has him in his own hands at
last, and is going to carry him across the border and into
a South Carolina bastille, as a little pleasantry on the
governor of South Carolina.”</p>

<p>“He’s had a sudden change of heart if he’s captured
Appleweight,” remarked a major incredulously. “His
policy has always been to let old Bill alone.”</p>

<p>“It’s only a ripple of the general reform wave that’s
sweeping the country,” suggested Ardmore cheerfully.
“Turn the rascals out; put the rascals in; keep the
people hopeful and the jails full. That’s the Dangerfield
watchword.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess Dangerfield knows how to drive the
hearse if there’s got to be a funeral,” observed the quartermaster.
“The governor’s not a man to ride inside
if he can find another corpse.”</p>

<p>And they all laughed and accepted the situation as
promising better diversion than they had expected from
the summer manœuvres.</p>

<p>The militia officers gave the necessary orders for breaking
the half-formed camp, and then turned their attention
to the entertainment of their guests. Ardmore
kept track of the time, and promptly at ten o’clock
Collins rose from the log by the roadside where they
had been sitting.</p>

<p>“We must obey the governor’s orders, gentlemen,”
said Collins courteously, “and march at once to Ardsley.
I, you understand, am only a courier, and your guest
for the present.”</p>

<p>“If you please,” asked Cooke, when the line had begun
to move forward, “what is that wagon over there?”</p>

<p>He pointed to a mule team hitched to a quartermaster’s
wagon that a negro was driving into position
across the rough field. It was piled high with luggage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
a pyramid that rose black against the heavens. One
of the militia officers, evidently greatly annoyed, bawled
to the driver to get back out of the way.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said Collins politely, “but is that your
personal baggage, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“That belongs to Colonel Gillingwater,” remarked the
quartermaster. “The rest of us have a suit-case apiece.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” demanded Ardmore, “that the adjutant-general
carries all that luggage for himself?”</p>

<p>“That is exactly it! But,” continued the quartermaster
loyally, “you can never tell what will happen
when you take the field this way, and our chief is not a
man to forget any of the details of military life.”</p>

<p>“In Washington we all think very highly of Colonel
Gillingwater,” remarked Collins, with noble condescension,
“and in case we should become involved in war
he would undoubtedly be called to high rank in the
regular establishment.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” said Cooke, as the three drew aside and
waited for a battery of light artillery to rumble into
place behind the infantry, “it’s too bad, Collins, that
it didn’t occur to you to impersonate the president of
the French Republic or Emperor William. You’ll be
my death before we finish this job.”</p>

<p>“This won’t be so funny when Dangerfield gets hold
of us,” grinned the reporter. “We’d better cheer up all
we can now. We’re playing with the state of North
Carolina as though it were a bean-bag. But what’s that
over there?”</p>

<p>The pyramidal baggage wagon had gained the road
behind them, and lingered uncertainly, with the driver
asleep and waiting for orders. The conspirators were
about to gallop forward to the head of the moving
column, when Collins pointed across the abandoned
camp-ground to where a horseman, who had evidently
made a wide detour of the advancing column, rode
madly toward the baggage wagon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“The gentleman’s trying to kill his horse, I should
judge,” murmured Ardmore. “By Jove!”</p>

<p>“It’s Gillingwater!” chorused the trio.</p>

<p>The rider in his haste had overlooked the men in the
road. He dashed through the wide opening in the fence,
left by the militiamen, took the ditch by the roadside
at a leap, wakened the sleeping driver on the wagon
with a roar, and himself leaped upon the box and began
turning the horses.</p>

<p>“What do you think he’s doing?” asked Cooke.</p>

<p>“He’s in a hurry to get back to mother’s cooking,”
replied Ardmore. “He’s seen Miss Dangerfield and
learned that war is at hand, and he’s going to get his
clothes out of danger. Lordy! listen to him slashing
the mules!”</p>

<p>“But you don’t think——”</p>

<p>The wagon had swung round, and already was in
rapid flight. Collins howled in glee.</p>

<p>“Come on! We can’t miss a show like this!”</p>

<p>“Leave the horses then! There’s a hill there that will
break his neck. We’d better stop him if we can!”
cried Cooke, dismounting.</p>

<p>They threw their reins to the driver of the wagon,
who had been brushed from his seat by the impatient
adjutant-general, and was chanting weirdly to himself
at the roadside.</p>

<p>The wagon, piled high with trunks and boxes, was
dashing forward, Gillingwater belabouring the mules
furiously, and, hearing the shouts of strange pursuers,
yelling at the team in a voice shrill with fear.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys!” shouted Ardmore, thoroughly
aroused, “catch the spy and traitor!”</p>

<p>The road dipped down into the shadow of a deep cut,
where the moon’s dim rays but feebly penetrated, and
where the flow of springs had softened the surface; but
the pursuers were led on by the rumble of the wagon,
which swung from side to side perilously, the boxes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
swinging about noisily and toppling threateningly at the
apex. Down the sharp declivity the wagon plunged like
a ship bound for the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>The pursuers bent gamely to their task in the rough
road, with Cooke slightly in the lead. Suddenly he
shouted warningly to the others, as something rose darkly
above them like a black cloud, and a trunk fell with a
mighty crash only a few feet ahead of them. The top
had been shaken off in the fall, and into it head first
plunged Ardmore.</p>

<p>“There’s another coming!” yelled Collins, and a much
larger trunk struck and split upon a rock at the roadside.
Clothing of many kinds strewed the highway.
A pair of trousers, flung fiercely into the air, caught on
the limb of a tree, shook free like a banner, and hung
there sombrely etched against the stars.</p>

<p>Ardmore crawled out of the trunk, screaming with
delight. The fragrance of toilet water broke freshly
upon the air.</p>

<p>“It’s his ammunition!” bawled Ardmore, rubbing his
head where he had struck the edge of a tray. “His
scent-bottles are smashed, and it’s only by the grace
of Providence that I haven’t cut myself on broken
glass.”</p>

<p>“Thump! bump!” sounded down the road.</p>

<p>“Are those pants up there?” asked Cooke, pointing,
“or is it a hole in the sky?”</p>

<p>“This,” said Collins, picking up a garment from the
bush over which it had spread itself, “has every appearance
of being his little nightie. How indelicate!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ardmore, taking it from him, “it’s a
kimona of the most expensive silk, which the colonel
undoubtedly wears when they get him up at midnight
to hear the reports of his scouts.”</p>

<p>They went down the road, stumbling now and then
over a bit of debris from the vanished wagon.</p>

<p>“It’s like walking on carpet,” observed Cooke, picking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
up a feathered chapeau. “I didn’t know there were so
many clothes in all the world.”</p>

<p>They abandoned the idea of further pursuit on reaching
a trunk standing on end, from which a uniform
dress-coat drooped sadly.</p>

<p>“This is not our trouble; it’s his trouble. I guess
he’s struck a smoother road down there. We’d better
go back,” said Cooke.</p>

<p>“Whom the gods would destroy they first dress in glad
rags,” piped Collins.</p>

<p>They sat down and laughed until the negro approached
warily with the horses.</p>

<p>“He’s lost his raiment, but saved his life,” sputtered
Collins, climbing into his saddle.</p>

<p>“He’s lost more than that,” remarked Ardmore, and
his flushed countenance, noted by the others as he
lighted a cigarette, was cheerfuller than they had ever
seen it before.</p>

<p>In a moment they had climbed the hill and were in
hot pursuit of the adjutant-general’s abandoned army.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />


<small>ON THE ROAD TO TURNER’S.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Who</span> goes there?”</p>

<p>“A jug.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a jug?”</p>

<p>“A little brown jug from Kildare.”</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Thomas Ardmore tested his pickets with a
shibboleth of his own devising. The sturdy militiamen
of North Carolina patrolled the northern bank of Raccoon
Creek at midnight, aware that that riotous flood
alone separated them from their foes. The terraces at
Ardsley bristled with the guns of the First Light Battery,
while, upon a cot in the wine cellar beneath, Mr.
Bill Appleweight, <i>alias</i> Poteet, slept the sleep of the just.</p>

<p>He was rudely aroused, however, at one o’clock in the
morning by Ardmore, Cooke, and Collins, and taken out
through the kitchen to one of the Ardsley farm wagons.
Big Paul held the reins, and four of Cooke’s detectives
were mounted as escort. Ardmore, Cooke, and Collins
were to accompany the party as a board of strategy in
the movement upon Turner Court House, South Carolina.</p>

<p>Appleweight, the terror of the border, blinked at the
lanterns that flashed about him in the courtyard. He
had been numbed by his imprisonment, and even now
he yielded himself docilely to the inevitable. His capture
in the first instance at Mount Nebo had been clear
enough, and he could have placed his hand on the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
who did it if he had been free for a couple of hours.
This he had pondered over his solacing solitaire as he
sat on the case of Chateau Bizet in the Ardsley wine
cellar; but the subsequent events had been altogether
too much for him. He had been taken from his original
captors by a girl, and while the ignominy of this was
not lost on the outlaw, his wits had been unequal to the
further fact, which he had no ground for disbelieving,
that this captivity within the walls of Ardsley had been
due to a daughter of that very governor of North Carolina
whom he had counted his friend. Why the girl
had interested herself in his seizure and incarceration;
why he had been carried to the great house of a New
York gentleman whom he had never harmed in the
least; and why, more than all, he should have been locked
in a room filled with bottles bearing absurd and unintelligible
titles, and containing, he had learned by much
despairing experiment, liquids that singularly failed to
satisfy thirst—these were questions before which Appleweight,
<i>alias</i> Poteet, bowed his head helplessly.</p>

<p>“The road between Kildare and Turner’s is fairly
good,” announced Cooke, “though we’ve got to travel
four miles to strike it. Griswold evidently thinks that
holding the creek is all there is of this business, and he
won’t find out till morning that we’ve crawled round his
line and placed Appleweight in jail at Turner’s where
he belongs.”</p>

<p>“You must have a good story ready for the press,
Collins,” said Ardmore. “The North Carolina border
counties don’t want Appleweight injured, and Governor
Dangerfield don’t want any harm to come to him—you
may be sure of that, or Bill would have been doing time
long ago. The moral element in the larger cities and
the people in Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts,
who only hear of Appleweight in the newspapers, want
him punished, and we must express to them our righteous
indignation that he has been kidnapped and dragged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
away from our vengeance by the governor of South
Carolina, who wants him in his own state merely to
protect him. We can come pretty near pleasing everybody
if you work it right, Collins. Our manner of
handling the matter will do much to increase Governor
Dangerfield’s popularity with all classes.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, it was very impolite of you not to tell
me you were ready to start!” and Jerry came briskly
from the side entrance, dressed for the saddle and nibbling
a biscuit.</p>

<p>“But you are not to go! I thought that was understood!”
cried Ardmore.</p>

<p>“It may have been understood by you, Mr. Ardmore,
but not by me! I should never forgive myself if, after
all the trouble I have taken to straighten out this little
matter, I should not be in at the finish. Will you
kindly get me a horse?”</p>

<p>Miss Dangerfield’s resolution was not to be shaken,
and a few minutes later the party moved out from the
courtyard. Cooke rode several hundred yards ahead;
then two detectives preceded the wagon, in which
Appleweight sat on a cross-seat with two more of Cooke’s
men on a seat just behind him. He was tied and gagged,
and an old derby hat (supplied by Paul) had been clapped
upon the side of his head at an angle that gave him a
jaunty air belied by his bonds. Though his tongue was
silenced, his eyes were at once eloquent of wonderment,
resignation, and impotent rage. Beside the wagon rode
Miss Jerry Dangerfield, alert and contented. Ardmore
and Collins were immediately behind her, and she indulged
the journalist in some mild chaff from time to
time, to his infinite delight, though considerably to
Ardmore’s distress of heart; for, though no words had
passed between him and Jerry as to the disgraceful
flight of the adjutant-general, yet the master of Ardsley
was in a jealous mood. The moon had left the conspirators
to the softer radiance of the stars, but there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
was sufficient light for Ardmore to mark the gentle lines
of Jerry’s face, as she lifted it now and then to scan the
bright globes above.</p>

<p>Paul drove his team at a trot over the smooth road
of the estate to a remote and little-used gate on the
southern side, but still safely removed from the South
Carolina pickets along the Raccoon.</p>

<p>“It’s all right over there,” remarked Collins, jerking
his head towards the creek. “The fronting armies are
waiting for morning and battle. I suppose that when
we send word to Griswold that Appleweight is in a South
Carolina jail it will change the scene of operations. It
will then be Governor Osborne’s painful task to dance
between law-and-order sentiment and the loud cursing
of his border constituents. The possibilities of this
rumpus grow on me, Ardmore.”</p>

<p>“There is no rumpus, Mr. Collins,” said Jerry over
her shoulder. “The governor of North Carolina is
merely giving expression to his civic pride and virtue.”</p>

<p>Leaving Ardsley, they followed a dismal stretch of road
until they reached the highway that connects Turner’s
and Kildare.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be morning pretty soon. We must get
the prisoner into Turner’s by five o’clock. Trot ’em up,
Paul,” ordered Cooke.</p>

<p>They were all in capital spirits now, with a fairly good
road before them, leading straight to Turner’s, and with
no expectation of any trouble in landing their prisoner
safely in jail. A wide publication of the fact that Appleweight
had been dragged from North Carolina and
locked in a South Carolina jail would have the effect of
clearing Governor Dangerfield’s skirts of any complicity
with the border outlaws, while at the same time
making possible a plausible explanation by Governor
Dangerfield to the men in the hills of the contemptible
conduct of the governor of South Carolina in effecting
the arrest of their great chief.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>They were well into South Carolina territory now, and
were jogging on at a sharp trot, when suddenly Cooke
turned back and halted the wagon.</p>

<p>“There’s something coming—wait!”</p>

<p>“Maybe Bill’s friends are out looking for him,” suggested
Collins.</p>

<p>“Or it may be Grissy,” cried Ardmore in sudden
alarm.</p>

<p>“Your professor is undoubtedly asleep in his camp on
the Raccoon,” replied Collins contemptuously. “Do not
be alarmed, Mr. Ardmore.”</p>

<p>Cooke impatiently bade them be quiet.</p>

<p>“If we’re accosted, what shall we say?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll say,” replied Jerry instantly, “that one of the
labourers at Ardsley is dead, and that we are taking his
remains to his wife’s family at Turner’s. I shall be his
grief-stricken widow.”</p>

<p>The guards already had Appleweight down on the
floor of the wagon, where one of them sat on his feet to
make sure he did not create a disturbance. At her own
suggestion Jerry dismounted and climbed into the wagon,
where she sat on the sideboard, with her head deeply
bowed as though in grief.</p>

<p>“Pretty picture of a sorrowing widow,” mumbled
Collins. Ardmore punched him in the ribs to make him
stop laughing. To the quick step of walking horses
ahead of them was now added the whisper and creak
of leather.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” yelled Cooke, wishing to take the
initiative.</p>

<p>“Hey-O!” answered a voice, and all was still.</p>

<p>“Give us the road; we’re taking a body into Turner’s
to catch the morning train,” called Cooke.</p>

<p>“Who’s dead?”</p>

<p>“One of Ardmore’s Dutchmen. Shipping the corpse
back to Germany.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>The party ahead of them paused as though debating
the case.</p>

<p>The north-bound party was a blur in the road. Their
horses sniffed and moved restlessly about as their riders
conferred.</p>

<p>“Give us the road!” shouted Cooke. “We haven’t
much time to catch our train.”</p>

<p>“Who did you say was dead?”</p>

<p>“Karl Schmidt,” returned Paul promptly.</p>

<p>Ardmore’s heart sank, fearful lest an inspection of
the corpse should be proposed. But at this moment a
wail, eerie and heart-breaking, rose and fell dismally
upon the night. It was Jerry mourning her dead husband,
her slight figure swaying back and forth over
his body in an abandon of grief.</p>

<p>“De poor vidow—she be mit us,” called out big Paul,
forsaking his usual excellent English for guttural dialect.</p>

<p>“Who are <i>you</i> fellows?” demanded Cooke, spurring
his horse forward. The horsemen, to his surprise,
seemed to draw back, and he heard a voice speak out
sharply, followed by a regrouping of the riders at the
side of the road.</p>

<p>“We been to a dance at Turner’s, and air goin’ back
home to Kildare,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“That seems all right,” whispered Ardmore to Collins.</p>

<p>“Thus,” muttered Collins, “in the midst of death
we are in life,” and this, reaching Jerry, caused her
to bend over the corpse at her feet as though in a convulsive
spasm of sorrow, whereupon, to add colour to
their story, Paul rumbled off a few consolatory sentences
in German.</p>

<p>“Give us the road!” commanded Cooke, and without
further parley they started ahead, closing about the
wagon to diminish, as far as possible, the size of the
caravan. Paul kept the horses at a walk, as became
their sad errand, and Jerry continued to weep dolorously.</p>

<p>They passed the horsemen at a slight rise in the rolling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
road. The party bound for Turner’s moved steadily
forward, the horsemen huddled about the wagon, with
Jerry’s led-horse between Ardmore and Collins at the
rear. At the top of the knoll hung the returning dancers,
well to the left of the road, permitting with due respect
the passing of the funeral party. One of the men,
Ardmore could have sworn, lifted his hat until the wagon
had passed. Then some one called good-night, and,
looking back, Ardmore saw them—a dozen men, he
judged—regain the road and quietly resume their journey
toward Kildare.</p>

<p>“Pretty peaceable for fellows who’ve been attending
a dance,” suggested Collins, craning his neck to look
after them.</p>

<p>Cooke turned back with the same observation, and
seemed troubled.</p>

<p>“I was afraid to look too closely at those men. They
seemed rather too sober, and I was struck with the fact
that they bunched up pretty close, as though they were
hiding something.”</p>

<p>“They were afraid of the corpse,” remarked Collins
readily. “To meet a dead man on a lonely road at
this hour of the morning is enough to sober the most
riotous.”</p>

<p>“One fellow lifted his hat as we passed, and I
thought——”</p>

<p>“Well, what did you think, Mr. Ardmore?” demanded
Cooke impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, it may seem strange, but I thought there was
something about that chap that suggested Grissy. It
would be like Grissy to lift his hat to a corpse under any
circumstances. He has spent a whole lot of time in
Paris, and besides, he never forgets his manners.”</p>

<p>“But suppose it was Griswold,” said Cooke, wishing
to dispose of the suspicion, “what could he be doing
out here? <i>He</i> hasn’t Appleweight—we know that; and
he has just now missed his chance of ever getting him.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>They paused to allow Jerry to resume her horse, and
one of the detectives joined in the conference to venture
his opinion that the men they had passed were in uniform.
“They looked like militia to me,” and as he was
a careful man, Cooke took note of his remark, though
he made no comment.</p>

<p>“Suppose they were in uniform,” said Jerry lightly;
“they can do no harm, and as we are now in South
Carolina, and they are not our troops, it would not
be proper for us to molest them. Let us go on, for
Mr. Appleweight’s widow is not anxious to miss her
train back to the fatherland.”</p>

<p>“If they were a detail of the enemy’s militia, they
would have held us up,” declared Cooke with finality.</p>

<p>But as they moved on toward Turner’s, Ardmore was
still troubled over what had seemed to him the remarkable
Parisian courtesy of the returning reveller who had
lifted his hat as the corpse passed. Grissy, he kept
saying over and over to himself, was no fool by any
manner of means, and he was unable to conjecture
why the associate professor of admiralty, known to be
detached on special duty for the governor of South
Carolina, should be riding to Kildare, unless he contemplated
some <i>coup</i> of importance.</p>

<p>The stars paled under the growing light of the early
summer dawn. Appleweight, with shoulders wearily
drooping, contemplated the attending cortege with the
gaze of one who sullenly accepts a condition he does not
in the least understand.</p>

<p>A few early risers saw the strange company enter and
proceed to the jail; but before half the community had
breakfasted, Bill Appleweight, the outlaw, was securely
locked in jail in Turner Court House, the seat of Mingo
County, in the state of South Carolina, and the jailer,
moreover, was sharing the distinguished captive’s
thraldom.</p>

<p>Collins, at the railway station, was announcing to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
world the fact that at the very moment when Governor
Dangerfield was about to seize Appleweight and punish
him for his crimes, the outlaw had been kidnapped in
North Carolina and taken under cover of night to a
jail in South Carolina where Governor Osborne might
be expected to shield him from serious prosecution with
all the power of his high office.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />


<small>THE BATTLE OF THE RACCOON.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atchison</span> met the returning adventurers at the
door.</p>

<p>“Your conduct, Jerry Dangerfield, is beyond words!”
she exclaimed, seizing the girl’s hands. “And so you
really locked that horrid person in a real jail! Well, we
shan’t miss him! We have been kept up all night by the
arrival here of other prisoners—brought in like parcels
from the grocer’s.”</p>

<p>“More prisoners!” shouted Ardmore.</p>

<p>“Dragged here at an unearthly hour of the morning,
and flung into the most impossible places by your soldiers!
You can hear them yelling without much
trouble from the drawing-room, and we had to give up
breakfast because the racket they are making was so
annoying.”</p>

<p>The captain of the battery whose guns frowned upon
the terraces came up and saluted.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore,” he said, “I have been trying for
several hours to see Governor Dangerfield, but this lady
tells me that he has left Ardsley.”</p>

<p>“That is quite true; the governor was called away
last night on official business, and he will not return
for an hour or two. You will kindly state your business
to me.”</p>

<p>The captain was peevish from loss of sleep, and by no
means certain that he cared to transact business with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
Mr. Ardmore. He glanced at Miss Dangerfield, whom he
had met often at Raleigh, and the governor’s daughter
met the situation promptly.</p>

<p>“Captain Webb, what prisoners have you taken, and
why are they not gagged to prevent this hideous noise?”</p>

<p>Seemingly from beneath the ample porte-cochère,
where this colloquy occurred, rose yells, groans and
curses, and the sound of thumps, as of the impact of
human bodies against remote subterranean doors.</p>

<p>“They’re trying to get loose, Miss Dangerfield, and
they refuse to stay tied. The fiercest row is from the
fellows we chucked into the coal bins.”</p>

<p>“It’s excellent anthracite, the best I can buy; they
ought to be glad it isn’t soft coal,” replied Ardmore
defensively. “Who are they?”</p>

<p>“They’re newspaper men, and they’re most terribly
enraged,” answered Captain Webb. “We picked them
up one at a time in different places on the estate. They
say they’re down here looking for Governor Dangerfield.”</p>

<p>Collins grinned his delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, perfect hour!” he sang. “We’ll keep them
until they promise to be good and print what we tell
them. The little squeaky voice you hear occasionally—hark!—that’s
Peck, of the Consolidated Press. He
scooped me once on a lynching, and here is where I
get even with him.”</p>

<p>“You have done well, Captain Webb,” said Jerry
with dignity, “and I shall urge your promotion upon
papa at the earliest moment possible. Are these newspaper
gentlemen your only prisoners?”</p>

<p>“No; we gathered up two other parties, and one of
them is in the servants’ laundry; the other, a middle-aged
person, I lodged in the tower, where he can enjoy
the scenery.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the tower, from which the flag of
North Carolina waved gently in the morning breeze.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“The prisoner up there made an awful rumpus. He
declares he will ruin the whole state of North Carolina
for this. Here is his card, which, in a comparatively
lucid interval, he gave me to hand you at the earliest
possible moment,” and Captain Webb placed a visiting
card in Ardmore’s hands.</p>

<p>A smile struggled for possession of Ardmore’s countenance,
but he regained control of himself promptly,
and his face grew severe.</p>

<p>He gave the card to Jerry, who handed it to Mrs.
Atchison, and that lady laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“Your prisoner, Captain Webb, is George P. Billings,
secretary of the Bronx Loan and Trust Company of New
York. What was he doing when you seized him?”
demanded Ardmore.</p>

<p>“He was chasing the gentleman who’s resting on the
anthracite. He chased him and chased him, around a
tea-house out here somewhere on the place; and finally
this person in the coal hole fell, and they both rolled
over together. The gentleman in the coal hole declares
that he’s Foster, the state treasurer of North Carolina,
but his face got so scratched on the shrubbery that he
doesn’t look in the least like Mr. Foster.”</p>

<p>“I have sent him witch hazel and court plaster, and
we can get a doctor for his wounds, if necessary,” said
Mrs. Atchison.</p>

<p>A sergeant rushed up in hot haste with a demand
from Colonel Daubenspeck, of the North Carolina First,
to know when Governor Dangerfield could be seen.</p>

<p>“The South Carolina pickets have been withdrawn,
and our officers want orders from the governor in
person,” said the messenger.</p>

<p>“Then they shall have orders!” roared Ardmore.
“If our men dare abandon their outposts——”</p>

<p>He turned and rode furiously toward the border, and
in his rage he had traversed a thousand yards before he
saw that Jerry was close behind him. As they passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
the red bungalow the crack of scattering rifle-shots
reached them.</p>

<p>“Go back! Go back! The war’s begun!” cried
Ardmore; but, though he quickened the pace of his
horse, Jerry clung to his side.</p>

<p>“If there’s war, and I hope there is, I shall not
shrink from the firing line, Mr. Ardmore.”</p>

<p>As they dashed into their own lines they came upon
the regimental officers, seated in comfortable chairs from
the red bungalow, calmly engaged in a game of cards.</p>

<p>“Great God, men!” blurted Ardmore, “why do you
sit here when the state’s honour is threatened? Where
was that firing?”</p>

<p>“You seem rather placid, gentlemen, to say the
least,” added Jerry, coldly bowing to the officers, who
had risen at her approach. “Unless I am greatly
mistaken, that is the flag of South Carolina I see flaunted
in yonder field.” And she pointed with a gauntleted
hand to a palmetto flag beyond the creek.</p>

<p>“It is, Miss Dangerfield,” replied the colonel politely,
“and you can see their pickets occasionally, but they
have been drawn back from the creek, and I apprehend
no immediate advance.”</p>

<p>“No advance! Who are we to wait for them to offer
battle? Who are we to play bridge and wait upon the
pleasure of a cowardly enemy?” and Jerry gazed upon
the furious Ardmore with admiration, as he roared at
the officers, who stood holding their caps deferentially
before the daughter of their commander-in-chief. Ardmore,
it was clear, they did not take very seriously,
a fact which she inwardly resented.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be quite fair,” said the colonel
mildly, “to force issues to-day.”</p>

<p>“Not force issues!” yelled Ardmore. “With your
brave sons of our Old North State, not force battle!
In the name of the constitution, I ask you, why not?”</p>

<p>“For the reason,” replied the colonel, “that the South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Carolina troops ate heavily of green apples last night in
an orchard over there by their camp, and they have
barely enough men to maintain their pickets this morning.
These, you can see, they have withdrawn a considerable
distance from the creek.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me why they have been firing upon our
lines? Why have they been permitted to shoot at our
helpless and unresisting men if they are not ready for
war?”</p>

<p>“They were not shooting at our men, Mr. Ardmore.
Their pickets are very tired from loss of sleep, and
they were trying to keep awake by shooting at a buzzard
that hung over a field yonder, where there is,
our scouts inform us, a dead calf lying in one of your
pastures.”</p>

<p>“They shall have better meat! Buzzards shall eat
the whole state of South Carolina before night! Colonel,
I order you to prepare at once to move your troops
across that creek.”</p>

<p>The colonel hesitated.</p>

<p>“I regret to say, sir, that we have no pontoons!”</p>

<p>“Pontoons! Pontoons! What, by the shade of
Napoleon, do you want with pontoons when you have
legs? Again, sir, I order you to advance your men!”</p>

<p>It was at this crisis that Jerry lifted her chin a trifle
and calmly addressed the reluctant colonel.</p>

<p>“Colonel Daubenspeck, in my father’s name, I order
you to throw your troops across the Raccoon!”</p>

<p>A moment later the clear notes of the bugle rose above
the splash and bubble of the creek. There was no opportunity
for a grand onward sweep; it must be a
scramble for the southern shore over the rocks and fallen
timber in that mad torrent.</p>

<p>And the Raccoon is a stream from all time dedicated
to noble uses and destined to hold mighty kingdoms in
leash. One might well hesitate before crossing this
wayward Rubicon. The Mississippi is merely an excuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
for appropriations, the Potomac the sporting ground of
congressmen and shad. No other known stream is so
happily calculated as the foamy Raccoon to delight at
once the gods of battle and the gentle sons of song. It
marks one of those impatient flings of nature in which,
bored with creating orderly, broadly-flowing streams, or
varying the landscape with quiet woodlands or meadows,
she abandons herself for a moment to madness and,
shaking water and rock together as in a dice-box,
splashes them out with joyous laughter.</p>

<p>Jerry Dangerfield, seated upon her horse on a slight
rise under a clump of trees a little way back from the
stream, coolly munched a cracker and sipped coffee
from a tin cup. Ardmore, again calm, now that Daubenspeck
had been spurred to action, smoked his pipe and
watched the army prepare to advance.</p>

<p>Beyond the creek, and somewhat removed from it on
the South Carolina side, a rifle cracked, and far against
the blue arch a huge, black, languorous object, rising
with a last supreme effort, as though to claim refuge of
heaven, fell clawing at space with sprawling wings, then
collapsed and pitched earthward until the trees on the
farther shore hid it from sight. A feeble cheer rose in
the distance.</p>

<p>“They sound pretty tame over there,” remarked Ardmore
critically. “There’s no ginger in that cheer.”</p>

<p>“The ginger,” suggested Colonel Daubenspeck ironically,
“is probably all in their stomachs.”</p>

<p>One gun from the battery was brought down and
placed on a slight eminence to support the advance, for
which all was now in readiness. The bugle sang again,
and the men of one company sprang forward and began
leaping from rock to rock, silently, steadily moving
upon the farther shore. Here and there some brown
khaki-clad figure slipped and splashed into the stream
with a wild confusion of brown leggings; but on they
went intrepidly. The captain, leading his men through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
the torrent, was first to gain the southern shore. He
waved his sword, and with a shout his men clambered
up the bank and formed in neat alignment. This was
hardly accomplished before a uniformed figure dashed
from a neighbouring blackberry thicket and waved a
white handkerchief. He bore something in his hand,
which to Ardmore’s straining vision seemed to be a
small wicker basket.</p>

<p>“It’s a flag of truce!” exclaimed Colonel Daubenspeck,
and a sigh that expressed incontestable relief
broke from that officer.</p>

<p>“The cowards!” cried Ardmore. “Does that mean
they won’t fight?”</p>

<p>“It means that hostilities must cease until we have
permitted the bearer of the flag to carry his message
into our lines.”</p>

<p>The man with the basket was already crossing the
creek in charge of a corporal.</p>

<p>“I have read somewhere about being careful of the
Greeks bearing gifts,” said Jerry. “There may be
something annoying in that basket.”</p>

<p>The bearer of the basket gained the North Carolina
shore and strode rapidly toward Miss Dangerfield, Ardmore,
and Colonel Daubenspeck. He handed the trifle
of a basket to the colonel, who gazed upon its contents
for a moment with unspeakable rage. The colour
mounted in his neck almost to the point of apoplexy,
and his voice bellowed forth an oath so bleak, so fraught
with peril to the human race, that Jerry shuddered and
turned away her head as from a blast of flame. The
colonel cast the wicker basket from him with a force
that nearly tore him from his saddle. It struck against
a tree, spilling upon the earth six small, hard, bright
green apples.</p>

<p>“My letter,” said the emissary soberly, “is for Mr.
Thomas Ardmore, and, unless I am mistaken, you are
that gentleman.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Ardmore seized a long envelope which the man extended,
tore it open, and read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Thomas Ardmore, Esq.,<br />
<span class="indentleft">Acting Governor of North Carolina,</span><br />
<span class="indentleft7">In the Field:</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>—As I understand the present unhappy differences between
the states of North and South Carolina, they are due to a reluctance
on the part of the governor of North Carolina to take steps toward
bringing to proper punishment in North Carolina an outlaw named
Appleweight. I have the honour to inform you that that person is
now in jail at Kildare, Dilwell County, North Carolina, properly guarded
by men who will not flinch. If necessary I will support them with every
South Carolinian able to bear arms. This being the case, a <i>casus belli</i>
no longer exists, and to prevent the effusion of blood I beg you to cease
your hostile demonstrations on our frontier.</p>

<p>Our men seized a few prisoners during the night, and I am willing
to meet you to arrange an exchange on the terms proper in such cases.</p>

<p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Henry Maine Griswold</span>, &#160; &#160; <br />
For the Governor of South Carolina.</p>
</div>

<p>“The nerve of it! The sublime cheek of it!” exclaimed
Ardmore, though the sight of Griswold’s well-known
handwriting had shaken him for the moment.</p>

<p>“As a bluffer your little friend is quite a wonder,”
was Jerry’s only comment when she had read the letter.</p>

<p>Ardmore promptly wrote on the back of Griswold’s
letter this reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Henry Maine Griswold, Esq.,<br />
<span class="indentleft8">Assistant Professor of Admiralty,</span><br />
<span class="indentleft3">Camp Buzzard, S. C.:</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>—Appleweight is under strong guard in the jail at Turner Court
House, Mingo County, South Carolina. I shall take pleasure in meeting
you at Ardsley at five o’clock this afternoon for the proposed exchange
of prisoners. To satisfy your curiosity the man Appleweight will be
produced there for your observation and identification.</p>

<p>I have the honour, sir, to remain, with high regard and admiration,
your obliged and obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Thomas Ardmore</span>, &#160; &#160; <br />
Acting Governor of North Carolina.</p>
</div>

<p>“Putting ‘professor’ on that will make him crazy,”
remarked Ardmore to Jerry.</p>

<p>The messenger departed, but recrossed the Raccoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
shortly with a formal note agreeing to an armistice
until after the meeting proposed at Ardsley.</p>

<p>“Colonel Daubenspeck, you may withdraw your men
and go into camp until further orders,” said Jerry, and
the notes of the bugle singing the recall rose sweetly
upon the air.</p>

<p>“By George,” said Ardmore, as he and Jerry rode
away, “we’ll throw it into old Grissy in a way that will
jar the professor. But when it comes to the exchange
of prisoners, I must tell the boys to bring up that chap
I locked in the corn-crib. I had clean forgotten him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you mentioned him, Mr. Ardmore, but
I suppose he’s one of the Appleweight ruffians.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” replied Ardmore, whose spirits had
never been higher, “though the fellow was not without
his pleasant humour. He insisted with great vigour that
he is the governor of South Carolina.”</p>

<p>“I wonder”—and Jerry spoke wistfully—“I wonder
where papa is!”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s not in the corn-crib; be sure of that.”</p>

<p>“Papa looks every inch the statesman,” replied Jerry
proudly, “and in his frock-coat no one could ever mistake
him for other than the patriot he is.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br />


<small>IN THE RED BUNGALOW.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> do you think,” cried Mrs. Atchison, glowing
before Jerry and Ardmore on their return; “we have
a new guest!”</p>

<p>“In the coal cellar?” inquired her brother.</p>

<p>“No, in the blue room adjoining Miss Dangerfield’s!
And what do you think! It is none other than the
daughter of the governor of South Carolina.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nellie!” gasped Ardmore.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” demanded Mrs. Atchison.
“I had gone in to Turner’s to look at that memorial
church we’re building there, and I learned from the
rector that Miss Osborne, with only a maid, was stopping
at that wretched hole called the Majestic Hotel.
I had met Miss Osborne in Washington last winter, and
you may forget, Tommy, that on our mother’s side I am
a Daughter of the Seminole War, a society of which
Miss Osborne is the president-general.—I hope Miss
Osborne’s presence here will not be offensive to you,
Miss Dangerfield. She seemed reluctant to come, but I
simply would not take no, and I am to send for her at
four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Miss Osborne’s presence is not only agreeable to me,
Mrs. Atchison,” responded Jerry, “but I shall join you
in welcoming her. I have heard that the ancestor
through whom Barbara Osborne derives membership in
the Daughters of the Seminole War was afterward convicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
of robbing an orphan of whose estate he was the
trusted executor, and such being the case I feel that the
commonest Christian charity demands that I should
treat her with the most kindly consideration. I shall
gather some roses, with your permission, and have them
waiting in her room when she arrives, with my card and
compliments.”</p>

<p>Ardmore had rarely been so busy as during the afternoon.
Several more newspaper correspondents were
found prowling about the estate, and they were added
to the howling mob in the Ardsley cellars. Collins
searched them and read their instructions with interest.
They were all commissioned to find the lost governors of
North and South Carolina; and a number were instructed
to investigate a rumour that North Carolina
was about to default her bonds through malfeasance of
the state treasurer. It was clear from the fact that
practically every newspaper in New York had sent its
best man to the field that the world waited anxiously for
news from the border.</p>

<p>“It has all happened very handily for us,” said Collins;
“we’ve got the highest-priced newspaper talent in
the world right under our hands, and before we turn
them loose we’ll dictate exactly what history is to know
of these dark proceedings. Those fellows couldn’t get
anything out of either Kildare or Turner’s for some
time, as Paul’s men have cut the wires and Cooke has
operators at the railway stations to see that nothing is
sent out.”</p>

<p>“When we’ve settled with Griswold and proved to
him that he’s lost out and that the real Mr. Appleweight
is in his jail, not ours, we’ll have to find Governor Dangerfield
and be mighty quick about it,” replied Ardmore.
“Paul says there’s a battery of South Carolina artillery
guarding the Dilwell County jail, and that they’ve fooled
the people into thinking they’re North Carolina troops,
and nobody can get within four blocks of the jail. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
must have somebody in jail at Kildare. I don’t like
the looks of it. I hope those men we left guarding old
Appleweight in the Mingo jail know their business. It
would be nasty to lose that old chap after all the trouble
he’s given us.”</p>

<p>“They’ll keep him or eat him, if I know old Cookie.”</p>

<p>Jerry—a pleasing figure to contemplate in white lawn
and blue ribbons—suggested that the meeting take place
in the library, as more like an imperial council chamber;
but Ardmore warmly dissented from this. A peace
should never be signed, he maintained, in so large a
house as Ardsley. At Appomattox and in many other
cases that he recalled, the opponents met in humble
farmhouses. It would be well, however, to have the
meeting on the estate, for the property would thus become
historic, but it would never do to have it take
place in the Ardsley library.</p>

<p>“There should be great difficulty in securing pens and
paper,” Ardmore continued, “and we must decline to
accept the swords of our fallen foes.”</p>

<p>They finally agreed on the red bungalow as convenient
and sufficiently modest for the purpose. And so it was
arranged.</p>

<p>A few minutes before five the flag of North Carolina
was hung from the wide veranda of the bungalow. At
the door stood an armed militiaman. Colonel Daubenspeck
had been invited to be present, and he appeared
accompanied by several other officers in full uniform.
Word of the meeting-place had been sent through the
lines to the enemy, and the messenger rode back with
Griswold, who was followed quickly by the adjutant-general
of South Carolina and half a dozen other officers.
The guard saluted as Griswold ran up the steps of the
veranda, and at the door Ardmore met him and greeted
him formally.</p>

<p>At the end of a long table Jerry Dangerfield sat with
her arms folded. She wore, as befitting the occasion, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
gray riding-dress and a gray felt hat perched a trifle to
one side.</p>

<p>She bowed coldly to Griswold, whose hand, as he surveyed
the room and glanced out at the flag that fluttered
in the doorway, went to his moustache with that gesture
that Ardmore so greatly disliked; but Griswold again
bowed gravely to his adversaries.</p>

<p>“Miss Dangerfield, and gentlemen,” began Griswold,
with an air of addressing a supreme tribunal, “I believe
this whole matter depends upon the arrest of
one Appleweight, a well-known outlaw of North Carolina——”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon——”</p>

<p>It was Jerry who interrupted him, her little fists
clenching, a glint of fire in her eyes.</p>

<p>“It is for me to ask your pardon, Miss Dangerfield!
Let us agree that this person is an unworthy citizen of
any state, and proceed. It has been your endeavour to
see this man under arrest in South Carolina, thus relieving
North Carolina or her chief executive of responsibility
for him. We, on our side, have used every
effort to lodge Appleweight in jail on your side of the
state line. Am I correct?”</p>

<p>Jerry nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>“Then, Miss Dangerfield, and gentlemen, I must tell
you that you have lost your contention, for Appleweight
spent last night in jail at Kildare, and to secure his
safe retention there, we generously lent your state a
few of our militia to guard him. The proceeding was a
trifle irregular, we admit—the least bit <i>ultra vires</i>—but
the peculiar situation seemed to justify us.”</p>

<p>“There are not two Bill Appleweights,” remarked
Colonel Daubenspeck. “I assure you that the real
criminal spent last night in jail at Turner Court House,
guarded by trustworthy men, and we are able to produce him.”</p>

<p>“The quickest way to settle this point, Professor Griswold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
is by bringing in your man,” remarked Ardmore
icily.</p>

<p>“On the other hand”—and Griswold’s tone was confident—“as
there is no reason for doubt that we have
the real Appleweight, and as we are on your territory
and in a measure your guests, it is only fair that you
produce the man you believe to be Appleweight, that
we may have a look at him first.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Jerry. “Our prisoner does not deny
his identity. It gives us pleasure to produce him.”</p>

<p>At a nod from Colonel Daubenspeck the orderly at the
door ran off to where Cooke and the prisoner waited.</p>

<p>In the interval there was a general exchange of introductions
at the bungalow. The adjutant-general of
South Carolina was in a merry mood, and began chaffing
Ardmore upon the deadly character of apples found in
his orchard beyond the Raccoon.</p>

<p>“I deeply regret,” said Ardmore, rubbing his chin,
“that the adjutant-general of North Carolina is suffering
from a severe attack of <i>paralysis agitans</i>, and will
be unable to meet with us.”</p>

<p>“I deplore the fact,” replied the adjutant-general of
South Carolina, “for one of our scouts picked up a
darky in the highway a while ago who had on a uniform
dress-coat with the initials ‘R. G.’ sewed in the
pocket.”</p>

<p>“If you will return that garment to me, General,”
said Ardmore, “I will see that it reaches Colonel Gillingwater
by special messenger, where, upon his couch of
pain, he chafes over his enforced absence from the field
of danger.”</p>

<p>Steps sounded on the veranda, and all rose as Cooke
appeared in the door, leading his handcuffed prisoner,
who stood erect and glared at the company in gloomy
silence.</p>

<p>“This man,” said Ardmore, “we declare to be Bill
Appleweight, <i>alias</i> Poteet.—I ask you, sir”—he addressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the prisoner—“to state whether you are not
known by one or both of these names?”</p>

<p>The man nodded his head and grumbled a reluctant
affirmative.</p>

<p>“Professor Griswold,” Ardmore went on, “the gentleman
in charge of the prisoner is Roger Cooke, for many
years in the secret service of the United States. He now
conducts a private agency, and is in my employ.—Mr.
Cooke, I will ask you whether you identify this man as
Appleweight?”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt of it whatever. I have known him
for years. I once arrested him for moonshining, and he
served a year in the penitentiary as the result of that
arrest.—You will pardon me, sir,” Cooke continued,
addressing Griswold directly, “but this is undoubtedly
the man you had yourself captured at Mount Nebo
Church two nights ago, but who was taken from you, as
you may not know, by Miss Geraldine Dangerfield. She
was lost in the woods and came upon the captive, much
to her own surprise.”</p>

<p>Griswold lifted his brows in amazement and turned
towards Jerry.</p>

<p>“If that is the case, Miss Dangerfield, I salute you!
I am sorry to confess, however, that I did not myself
see the man who was captured by my friends at the
church, owing, it appears, to Miss Dangerfield’s prompt
and daring action, and the regrettable cowardice of my
men. I want to say to you, gentlemen, in all frankness,
that I am greatly astonished at what you tell me. Our
prisoner is about the same height as this man, has the
same slight stoop in the shoulders, and the same short
beard; but there the resemblance ends.”</p>

<p>Ardmore was trying not to show too plainly his joy
at Griswold’s discomfiture. None of the South Carolina
officers had ever seen Appleweight, as they lived
remote from the scene of his exploits. Habersham’s
men, who had so signally failed in the descent upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
Mount Nebo Church, had taken to the woods on the
appearance of the state soldiery along the border, and
could not be found to identify the man seized at the
house on the creek. Habersham had discreetly declined
to support Griswold’s venture at the last moment; to
do so would, he pleaded, ruin his chances of political
preferment in the future; or worse things might, indeed,
happen if he countenanced and supported the armed
invasion of North Carolina by South Carolina militia.
The zealous young militiamen who had captured the
stranger in the house on the creek had pronounced the
man Appleweight, and their statement had been accepted
and emphasized when the man was taken before
Griswold, to whom he had stubbornly refused to make
any statement whatever.</p>

<p>“Now that you cannot deny that we have the real
Appleweight,” began Jerry, “who is, you must remember,
a prisoner of the state of South Carolina, and must
be returned to the Mingo County jail at once, I think
we may as well look at your prisoner, Professor Griswold.
He may be one of Mr. Appleweight’s associates in business;
but as we are interested only in the chief culprit,
the identity of the man you hold is of very little interest
to us.”</p>

<p>“If,” said Griswold, “he is not Appleweight, the original
blown in the bottle——”</p>

<p>“Jug, if you please!” interposed Ardmore very seriously.</p>

<p>“Then we don’t care about him, and I shall make you
a present of him.”</p>

<p>“Or,” remarked Ardmore, “I might exchange him for
a ruffian I captured myself down on the Raccoon. He
seemed quite insane, declaring himself to be the governor
of South Carolina, and I locked him up in a corn-crib
for safe keeping.”</p>

<p>“Any man,” said Jerry, lifting her chin slightly, “who
would impersonate the governor of South Carolina would,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
beyond question, be utterly insane and an object of
compassion. Professor Griswold, will you please produce
your imaginary Appleweight, as at this hour Mrs.
Atchison usually serves tea. Let us therefore make
haste.”</p>

<p>One of Griswold’s retinue ran off to summon the
prisoner, who was guarded by half a dozen soldiers
near at hand.</p>

<p>The company in the bungalow were all laughing
heartily at some sally by the adjutant-general of South
Carolina, who insisted upon giving a light note to the
proceedings, when hurried footsteps sounded on the
veranda, and a sergeant appeared in the doorway and
saluted.</p>

<p>The adjutant-general, annoyed at being interrupted
in the telling of a new story, frowned and bade the
sergeant produce his prisoner. At once a man was
thrust into the room, a tall man, with a short, dark
beard and slightly stooping shoulders. The strong light
at his back made it difficult for the people grouped about
the table to see his face clearly, but the air somehow
seemed charged with electricity, and all bent forward,
straining for a sight of the captive. As he stood framed
in the doorway his face was slowly disclosed to them,
and there appeared to be a humorous twinkle in his
eyes. Before any one spoke, he broke out in a hearty
laugh. Then a cry rose piercingly in the quiet room—a
cry of amazement from the lips of Jerry Dangerfield,
who had taken a step forward.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” she cried.</p>

<p>“The Governor!” roared Colonel Daubenspeck, leaping
across the table.</p>

<p>“It’s Governor Dangerfield!” shouted half a dozen
men in chorus.</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Atchison and Miss Barbara Osborne
stole softly in and ranged themselves at the back
of the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>The governor of North Carolina alone seemed to derive
any pleasure from the confusion and astonishment
caused by his appearance. He crossed to the table and
took his daughter’s hand.</p>

<p>“Jerry, what part do you play in these amateur
theatricals?”</p>

<p>Jerry rose, thrusting her handkerchief into her sleeve,
and her lips trembled slightly, though whether with
mirth or some soberer emotion it would be difficult to
say. The room at once gave her attention, seeing that
she was about to speak.</p>

<p>“Papa, before these people I am not ashamed to confess
that during your absence from the seat of government
I took it upon myself to fill your office to the best
of my ability, finding that many important matters were
pressing and that you had gone into exile without leaving
your address behind. I made Mr. Ardmore, the gentleman
on my left in the pearl-gray suit and lavender tie,
first private secretary, and then, when occasion required,
acting governor, though in reality he did nothing without
my entire approval. I am happy to say that nothing
has been neglected, and your reputation as a great
statesman and friend of the people has not suffered at
our hands. We arrested Mr. Appleweight, who is standing
there by the fireplace, and landed him in the Mingo
County jail as a joke on Governor Osborne, and to
appease the demands of the press and the Woman’s
Civic League of Raleigh. The copies of our correspondence
on this and other matters will tell you the
story more completely. And as for Governor Osborne,
I have taught him a lesson in the etiquette that should
obtain between governors that he is not likely to forget.
You will find that we have not hesitated to grant pardons,
and we have filled, in one instance, the office of
justice of the peace, made vacant by resignation. The
key to your desk, papa, is behind the clock on the
mantel in your private room.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“Ladies and gentlemen,” began the governor of North
Carolina, laying a hand upon the table, and with the
other seizing the lapel of his rough, brown coat—a pose
made familiar by all his photographs—“the jails of
North Carolina are more uncomfortable than I had believed
them to be, and I have taken a slight cold which
compels me to be briefer than this interesting occasion
demands. You have witnessed here an exhibition of
filial devotion that has, I am sure, touched us all. It is
well worth while for me to have suffered arrest and imprisonment
to realize the depth of my daughter’s love,
and the jealousy with which she has safeguarded my
private and public honour.”</p>

<p>He felt for a handkerchief and touched it gently to
his eyes; but Collins declared afterward that Governor
Dangerfield was exactly like his daughter, and that one
never could be sure that his mirth was genuine.</p>

<p>“I was aware only yesterday, when I saw a newspaper
for the first time in a week, that political capital was
being made of my absence from Raleigh; and that my
dear friend, the governor of South Carolina, also, was
being called to account for flinching in the face of imperative
duty.”</p>

<p>“Your friend, Governor?” cried Ardmore, unable to
restrain himself.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Ardmore,” continued Governor Dangerfield.
“That angry parting of ours at New Orleans
was all for effect to get space in the newspapers. We
had confided to each other that the cares of state had
worn us to an intolerable point, and that we must have
rest. Brother Appleweight had, I confess, given us both
a great deal of annoyance, and to be frank, neither
Osborne nor I wished to take the initiative in his case.
So we resolved to disappear, and go to some quiet place
for rest. We outfitted with old clothes and came to the
border. Governor Osborne has a farm over there somewhere
in Mingo County, and we made it our headquarters;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
but in roaming about we came upon that
charming shanty of yours, Mr. Ardmore, down on the
Raccoon. The house was deserted, and finding the
marks of the official survey running clearly through the
timber, we were amused to find that the house was
partly in North, partly in South, Carolina. The thing
touched our fancy. A negro cooked for us—what has
become of him I do not know. We cut ourselves off from
the mail and telegraph and received no newspapers until
a packet came yesterday, and it was only a few minutes
after I saw from the headlines of the <i>Vidette</i> what a row
was going on that I realized that strange things may
happen when the king goes a-hunting.”</p>

<p>As he paused, Miss Osborne stepped forward, the men
making way for her.</p>

<p>“If this be true, Governor Dangerfield, may I ask
you, sir, what has become of my father?”</p>

<p>Governor Dangerfield smiled.</p>

<p>“I regret, Miss Barbara, that I cannot answer that
question; I must refer it to my daughter.”</p>

<p>“Miss Osborne,” responded Jerry, “while I should
be glad to assist you in recovering your father as a
slight return for your having placed mine in the
Dilwell County jail and kept him there all night, I
regret that I am unable to be of the slightest help to
you.”</p>

<p>The perspiration was beading Ardmore’s brow, but
he smiled as though in joy at Jerry’s readiness.</p>

<p>“We have taken a number of prisoners,” said Ardmore,
meeting the governor’s glance, “and while I do
not think Governor Osborne can possibly be of the number,
yet I shall be glad to produce them all. There’s
a person in the corn-crib a little way across country
whom I captured myself. I believe he’s now tied to a
mulberry tree a little way down the road, as he pretended
to be the governor of South Carolina, and I
feared that he might do himself some harm.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>Before he ceased speaking big Paul strode in, an
angry and crestfallen man following at his heels.</p>

<p>“Oh, father!”</p>

<p>It was Barbara Osborne’s voice; but whatever of
anger or joy there may have been in her words and
tone was lost in the shout of laughter that broke from
Governor Dangerfield. The governor of South Carolina
was in no such high humour. He sputtered, swore,
stamped his foot, and struck the table with his clenched
hand as he demanded to know the meaning of the
outrageous indignity to which he had been subjected.</p>

<p>The more his friend stormed the more Governor
Dangerfield roared with laughter, but when he could
control himself he laid an arresting arm on Governor
Osborne’s shoulder, and spoke to Barbara.</p>

<p>“Barbara, may I ask whether you, like my own Jerry,
have been protecting your father’s fair name during his
absence; and does that account for my night spent in the
jail at Kildare? If so——”</p>

<p>Governor Dangerfield’s laughter got the better of him,
but Barbara, with dignity, turned to her father.</p>

<p>“It is quite true, that finding your absence occasioning
serious remark, while your attorney-general took
advantage of your absence to annoy me in a most
cowardly fashion, with the kind help of Professor Griswold,
I did all in my power to thwart your enemies,
and to show the people of South Carolina that you
were not a man to evade the responsibilities of your
office. As to the details of these matters I prefer, father,
to speak to you in private.”</p>

<p>“Professor Griswold?” repeated Governor Osborne
haughtily. “I believe I have not the honour of the
gentleman’s acquaintance;” whereupon, to ease the
situation, Ardmore presented his old friend.</p>

<p>“Governor Osborne, allow me to present Professor
Henry Maine Griswold, associate professor of admiralty
in the University of Virginia, and the author of——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Griswold?” The anger slowly left Governor Osborne’s
face. “Do I understand that you belong to the
Virginia tide-water family of that name? Then, sir,
without hesitation I offer you my hand.”</p>

<p>“Osborne,” cried Governor Dangerfield, “we have
every reason to be proud of our daughters. They have
done their best for us; and they seem to have acted
wisely in accepting aid from these gentlemen; and
now, what is to be done with Bill Appleweight?”</p>

<p>“We have with us that requisition you left on your
desk,” exclaimed Barbara, turning to her father.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that won’t help,” laughed Governor Osborne,
“that requisition, Barbara, is purely Pickwickian
in character.”</p>

<p>“The disposition of Appleweight,” said Cooke, “is a
matter of delicacy for both of you gentlemen, and you
will pardon me for thrusting myself forward, but that
this affair may end happily for all, neither North nor
South Carolina should bear the burden of prosecuting a
man to whom—we may say it as between friends here—the
governors of both states are under some trifling
obligations.”</p>

<p>The governor of North Carolina exchanged a glance
and a nod with the governor of South Carolina.</p>

<p>“Therefore,” resumed Cooke, “we must hit upon a
plan of action that will eliminate both states from the
controversy. I will, with your permission, turn Appleweight
over to the United States revenue officers who
are even now in this neighbourhood looking for him.”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Jerry. “We shall do nothing of the
kind! I met Mr. Appleweight under peculiar circumstances,
but I must say that I formed a high opinion of his
chivalry, and I beg that we allow him to take a little
trip somewhere until the Woman’s Civic League of
Raleigh and the carping Massachusetts press have
found other business, and he can return in peace to his
home.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“That,” said Governor Osborne, “meets my approval.”</p>

<p>“And I,” Ardmore added, “will give him my private
caboose in which to cruise the larger Canadian cities.”</p>

<p>Two more prisoners were now brought in.</p>

<p>“Governor Dangerfield,” continued Ardmore, “here
is your state treasurer, who had sought to injure you by
defaulting the state bonds due to-day, which is the first
of June. And that frowsy person with Mr. Foster is
Secretary Billings, of the Bronx Loan and Trust Company,
who has treated me at times with the greatest injustice
and condescension. Whether Treasurer Foster
has the money with which to meet those bonds I do not
know; but I do know that I have to-day paid them in
full through the Buckhaw National Bank of Raleigh.”</p>

<p>Colonel Daubenspeck leaped to his feet and swung
his cap. He proposed three cheers for Jerry Dangerfield;
and three more for Barbara Osborne; and then
the two governors were cheered three times three; and
when the bungalow had ceased to ring, it was seen that
Ardmore and Griswold were in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>“Surely, by this time,” said Mrs. Atchison, “you
have adjusted enough of these weighty matters for one
day, and I beg that you will all dine with us at Ardsley
to-night at eight o’clock, where my brother and I will
endeavour to mark in appropriate fashion the signing
of peace between your neighbouring kingdoms.”</p>

<p>“For Governor Osborne and myself I accept, madam,”
replied Governor Dangerfield, “providing the flowing
frock-coats, which are the vesture and symbol of our
respective offices, are still in the log house on the Raccoon
where I became a prisoner.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br />


<small>ROSÆ MUNDI.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atchison</span> and Ardmore had given their last touches
to the preparations for the dinner. Every window of the
great house shone and a myriad of lanterns illuminated
the lawns and terraces. The flags of North and South
Carolina were everywhere entwined; nor were the stars
and stripes neglected. They surveyed the long table
in the dining-room, where gold and silver and crystal
were bright upon the snowy napery.</p>

<p>“The matter of precedence is serious, Tommy,” urged
Mrs. Atchison. “I cannot for the life of me remember
what two monarchs do about entering a room at the
same time.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I, Nellie,” said Ardmore; “unless they
sprint for the door, and the one who gets through first
takes the head of the table. Still, that would be undignified,
particularly if the kings were old and fat, and
if they bumped going through the door and took a
header it would jar the divine right.”</p>

<p>“Here in democratic America,” said Griswold, joining them,
“there can be no such preposterous idea of
precedence.”</p>

<p>“I should think better of that notion, Professor
Griswold,” laughed Mrs. Atchison, “if I had never
seen the goats carefully shepherded to keep them away
from the lambs at functions in Washington. Democracy
may be a political triumph, but it is certainly deficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
socially. Personally I have always wished to bring
myself in touch with the poor. Ardy is quite right
that our own kind are distinctly uninteresting.”</p>

<p>“You ought to remember, Nellie, that your idea of
going slumming in a purple coupé and dressed up in
your best rags is not well calculated to inspire confidence
and affection among the submerged. But how to
handle two governors has me fussed. You are the
hostess, and it’s for you to decide which excellency shall
take you in. I see no way out but to match for it.”</p>

<p>“That will be unnecessary,” said Mrs. Atchison, “for
the doors and the hall are broad enough for a dozen
governors to march in abreast.”</p>

<p>“That would never do, Nellie! You don’t understand
these things. You can’t hitch up a brace of
American governors in a team and drive them like a
pair of horses. At least, speaking for the Old North
State, I will say that we can never consent to any such
compromise.”</p>

<p>“And I, speaking for the great Palmetto Commonwealth,
not less emphatically reject the idea!” declared
Griswold.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Mrs. Atchison, “there is only one possible
solution. When the rest of us have entered the
dining-room and taken our places, a bugle will sound;
the governor of North Carolina shall enter from the
north door; the governor of South Carolina from the
south door, and advance to seats facing each other midway
of the table. Professor Griswold, you are an old
friend of the family, and you shall yourself take me
in to dinner.”</p>

<p>The members of Mrs. Atchison’s house party, well
distributed among the official guests, were still somewhat
at a loss to know what had happened, but it seemed
to be in the air that Tommy Ardmore had at last done
something, though just what was not wholly clear. It
was sufficiently obvious, however, that the little girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
with blue eyes who had the drollest possible way of talking,
and whom one never seemed able to take off guard,
had seized strong hold upon the master of Ardsley;
and she, on her part, treated him with the most provoking
condescension. It was agreed by all that Miss
Osborne was distinguished and lovely and that Professor
Griswold did not seem out of place at her side.</p>

<p>The talk grew general after the first restraint was
over, and Mrs. Atchison dropped just the right word
here and there to keep the ball rolling. Governor
Osborne had generously forgotten and forgiven his
painful incarceration in the corn-crib, and he and
Governor Dangerfield vied with each other in avowing
their determination to live up to the high standards
that had been set for them by their daughters.</p>

<p>Both governors had at almost the same moment
turned down their glasses. It even seemed that they
had been drilled in the part, so dexterous were they in
reversing them, so nimbly did they put from them the
hope of wine. The members of the house party noted
this act of the two governors with well-bred surprise;
and Ardmore was grieved, feeling that in some measure
the illustrious guests were criticising his hospitality.
The butler at this moment spoke to him, and much
relieved he smiled and nodded. A moment later two
jugs, two little brown jugs, were carried in, and one was
placed quietly in front of each governor at precisely
the same moment. Expectation was instantly a-tiptoe.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Ardmore, addressing the governors,
“these jugs have just been left at the house by
our old friend, Mr. Bill Appleweight, <i>alias</i> Poteet, with
his compliments, for the governors of the two greatest
states in the Union. I note that there’s a bit of pink
calico around the stopper of Governor Dangerfield’s jug,
while Governor Osborne’s is garnished with blue and
white gingham.”</p>

<p>Governor Osborne rose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“In politics,” he began, resting his hand gently on the
jug, “it would be a fine thing if we could all live up
to our noblest ideals, but unfortunately we must be all
things to all men. What I have here is not merely the
testimonial of a valued constituent, but something much
subtler than that, ladies and gentlemen—a delicate proof
that those of us who would command the good-will and
suffrages of the people must keep a careful eye on the
weather-vane. This jug, which you probably all believe
contains the rude product of some hidden still, is as
equivocal as a political platform. I will illustrate my
meaning.”</p>

<p>All eyes were bent upon the governor of South Carolina
as he picked up the jug, twisted the cob stopper for
a moment, and then poured into a tumbler which the
butler placed for him a clear white fluid; then, turning
the stopper slightly, he poured into another glass a
thick milk-like liquid.</p>

<p>“When among my constituents I almost invariably
call for a gourd for drinking purposes in preference to a
tumbler; but in this company I shall abandon a custom
of the plain people and yield to the habits of the sons
of Mammon. I am here, I take it, once more in my
official capacity as governor of South Carolina, and as I
am not one to offend the best sentiments of my people, I
pledge you, my friends, not in the untaxed corn whisky
of Appleweight’s private still, but in the excellent and
foamy buttermilk of Mrs. Appleweight’s homely churn.”</p>

<p>As he concluded, Governor Dangerfield rose and performed
exactly the same solemn rite with the jug before
him, pouring whisky into one glass, buttermilk into
the other, and leaning across the table he touched his
tumbler of buttermilk to that extended by Governor
Osborne. When the applause that greeted this exchange
of courtesies had subsided, Governor Dangerfield
was still standing, and in a quiet conversational tone,
and with a manner engagingly frank, he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“Before it seemed expedient to follow the reform
bandwagon, I held certain principles touching the drinking
habit. But the American bar has destroyed drinking
as a fine art, and it has now become a vulgar habit. In
the good old times no gentleman ever jumped at his
liquor. He took it with a casual air, even with a sanctifying
reluctance. The idea of rushing into a public
place and gulping your liquor is repugnant to the most
primary of the instincts that govern gentlemen. To
precipitate a gill of applejack into that most delicate
organism, the human stomach, without the slightest
warning, is an insult to the human body—ay, more, it is
an outrage upon man’s very soul. The aim of liquor,
ladies and gentlemen, is to stay and lift the spirit, not
to degrade it. Drinking at proper intervals ceased to
be respectable at a fixed date in human progress—to
be exact, at the moment when it was no longer a
mere incident of personal or social recreation but had
become a sociological and political issue, staggering
drunkenly under a weary burden of most painful statistics.”</p>

<p>“You are eminently right, Governor Dangerfield,”
said the governor of South Carolina, helping himself
to the salted almonds; “but you have used a phrase
which piques my curiosity. Will you kindly enlighten
us as to how you interpret proper intervals?”</p>

<p>“With greatest pleasure,” responded Governor Dangerfield.
“I remember, as though it were yesterday, my
venerable grandfather saying that no gentleman should
ever approach the sideboard oftener than once before
breakfast, and he was himself a very early riser. I discount
this, however, because he always slept with a jug
of Cuban rum—the annual offering of a West Indian
friend—easily within his reach at the head of his bed.
It was his practice for years to sip a little rum and
water while he shaved. He was a gentleman if ever I
knew one, and as I look upon him as a standard authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
in all matters of deportment and morals, I may safely
cite him further in answer to your question.</p>

<p>“During the long open season in our country my
grandfather constantly rode over the plantation in immaculate
white duck, followed by a darky on a mule
carrying a basket. On our ancestral estate there were
many springs giving the purest and coldest of water,
and these were providentially scattered at the most convenient
intervals for my grandfather’s comfort. And as
a slight return to nature for what she had done for him
in this particular, my grandfather, in his early youth,
had planted mint around all these springs. I need
hardly point out the advantages of this happiest of
combinations—a spring of clear, icy water; the pungent
bouquet of lush mint; the ample basket borne by
a faithful negro, and my grandfather, in his white duck
suit and a Panama hat a yard wide, seated by the
mossy spring, selecting with the most delicate care
the worthiest of the fragrant leaves.</p>

<p>“Now”—and Governor Dangerfield smiled—“I can
see that you are all busy guessing at the number of
stops made by my grandfather in the course of a day,
and I hasten to satisfy your curiosity. My grandfather
always started out at six o’clock in the morning, and
the springs were so arranged that he had to make six
stops before noon, and four in the afternoon; but at
five o’clock, when he reached home all fagged out by a
hard day’s work and sorely needing refreshment, a
pitcher of cherry bounce was waiting for him on the west
gallery of the house. After that he took nothing but a
night-cap on retiring for the night. To my friend, the
governor of South Carolina, I need offer no apologies for
my grandfather, once a senator in Congress, and a man
distinguished for his sobriety and probity. He was an upright
man and a gentleman, and died at ninety-two, full
of years and honours, and complaining, almost with his
last breath, of a distressing dusty feeling in the throat.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>When, as time passed, it seemed that every one had
told a story or made a speech, it was Ardmore’s inspiration
that Griswold should sing a song. The associate
professor of admiralty in the University of Virginia
had already pledged the loyalty of his state to her neighbours
and twin sisters, the Carolinas, and Barbara, who
wore a great bunch of her own white roses, had listened
to him with a new respect and interest, for he spoke
well, with the special grace of speech that men of his
state have, and with little turns of humour that kept
the table bubbling merrily.</p>

<p>“I shall comply with your request, my friends, if you
can bear with the poor voice of one long out of tune,
and if our host still has in the house a certain ancient
guitar I remember from old times. But I must impose
one condition, that I shall not again in this place be
called by my academic title. I have known wars and
the shock of battle along the Raccoon”—here his hand
went to his lips in the gesture that had so often distressed
Ardmore—“and I have known briefly the joy
of a military title. Miss Osborne conferred on me in an
emergency the noble title of major, and by it I demand
hereafter to be known.”</p>

<p>The governor of South Carolina was promptly upon
his feet.</p>

<p>“Henry Maine Griswold,” he said in his most official
manner, “I hereby appoint you a major on my staff with
all the rights, privileges, and embarrassments thereunto
belonging, and you shall to-morrow attend me personally
in my inspection of our troops in the field.”</p>

<p>As the guitar was placed in Griswold’s hands, Ardmore
caused all the lights to be turned out save those on
the table. In the soft candle-glow Ardmore bent his
face upon Jerry, who had been merrily chaffing him at
intervals, but who feigned at other times an utter ignorance
of his presence on earth. As Griswold’s voice rose
in the mellow dusk it seemed to Ardmore that the song<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
spoke things he could not, like his friend, put into utterance,
and something fine and sweet and hallowed—that
sweet sabbath of the soul that comes with first love—possessed
him, and he ceased looking at Jerry, but bent
his head and was lost in dreams. For the song and the
voice were both beyond what the company had expected.
It was an old air that Griswold sang, and it gave charm
to his words, which were those of a man who loves deeply
and who dares speak them to the woman he loves. They
rose and fell in happy cadences, and every word rang
clear. In the longer lines of the song there was a quickening
of time that carried the sense of passion, and
Griswold lifted his head when he uttered them and let
them cry out of him.</p>

<p>One of Barbara’s white roses had fallen into her lap,
and she played with it idly; but after the first verse it
slipped from her fingers, and she folded her arms on the
table and bent her gaze on the quiet flame of the candle
before her. And this was the song that Griswold sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Fair winds and golden suns</div>
<div class="indent">Down the year’s dim aisles of gray depart;</div>
<div class="verse">But you are the dear white rose of the world</div>
<div class="indent">That I hide in my heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Last leaves, and the first wild snow,</div>
<div class="indent">And the earth through an iron void is whirled;</div>
<div class="verse">But safe from the tempest abide in my heart,</div>
<div class="indent">O dear white rose of the world!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Blithe air and flashing wing.</div>
<div class="indent">And awakened sap that thrills and flows;</div>
<div class="verse">But hid from the riot and haste of the spring</div>
<div class="indent">Sleeps one white rose.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O scattered leaves of days!</div>
<div class="indent">O low-voiced glories that fade and depart!</div>
<div class="verse">But changeless and dear through the changing year</div>
<div class="indent">Blooms one white rose in my heart.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The last words hung tremulously, tenderly, on the
air, and left a spell upon the company that no one seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
anxious to break; then there was long applause and cries
of encore; but Ardmore, who knew that his friend had
been greatly moved, drew attention away from him to
Collins, who had just entered the room.</p>

<p>The correspondent had been called away shortly before
from the table, and he wore the serious air of one
heavy with news.</p>

<p>“I beg to report that I have just completed a treaty
with the journalists assembled in the cellar.”</p>

<p>“I hope, Mr. Collins, that the journalists’ convention
below stairs realized that the lobster we sent them for
supper was not canned, and that the mushrooms were
creamed for their refreshment by Mrs. Atchison’s special
command. It is not for us to trifle with the dignity of
the press,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“The reputations of two governors and of two states
are in their hands,” said the governor of South Carolina,
with feeling. “It would be a distressing end of my
public services if the truth of all these matters should
be known. The fact that Governor Dangerfield and I
had merely withdrawn from public life for a little quiet
poker in the country would sound like the grossest immorality
to my exacting constituency.”</p>

<p>“Both yourself and Governor Dangerfield will be relieved
to know that they have accepted my terms, and
all is well,” responded Collins. “They will tell the
waiting world that you have both been the guests of
Mr. Ardmore, and that the troops assembled on the
Raccoon are merely at their usual summer manœuvres.
As for Appleweight, it has seemed expedient that he
should be dead, and the man who has been called by
that name of late is only an impostor seeking a little
cheap notoriety. The boys are very sick of the cellar,
and they would do even more than this to get away.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Collins,” said Governor Dangerfield, rising,
“your great merits shall not go unrewarded. I have
carelessly neglected to appoint a delegate from North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
Carolina to the annual conference of the Supreme Lodge
of the Society of American Liars shortly to meet at
Lake Placid, New York. As a slight testimonial of my
confidence and admiration, I hereby appoint you to
represent the Old North State at that meeting, and your
expenses shall be paid from the public purse.”</p>

<p>“The boys wish to see your excellencies before they
leave,” said Collins when he had acknowledged the governor’s
compliment; and as he spoke the sound of great
cheering broke through the windows, and Mrs. Atchison
promptly rose and led the way to the broad terraces
which were now gay with coloured lanterns.</p>

<p>“Speech! speech!” cried the corps of correspondents.
Then Ardmore seized Governor Osborne’s hand and led
him forward to the balustrade; but before the governor
of South Carolina could speak, the group of newspaper
men began chanting, in the manner of a college antiphonal:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">What did he say to you?</div>
<div class="verse">What did he say to you?</div>
<div class="indent2"><i>What did who say?</i></div>
<div class="verse">What did the governor of North Carolina</div>
<div class="indent4">SAY</div>
<div class="verse">To the governor of South Carolina?</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Gentlemen,” began Governor Osborne, speaking with
great deliberation, “I am profoundly touched by the
cordiality of your greeting. (Applause.) Amid the perplexities
of my official life I am deeply sensible always
of the consideration and generosity of our free and untrammelled
American press. (Cheers.) Without your
support and approval, my best aims, my sincerest endeavours
in behalf of the people, must fall short and
fail of their purpose. (A voice: You’re dead right
about that.) I am proud of this opportunity to greet
this most complimentary delegation of men distinguished
in the noble profession of which Greeley, Raymond, and
Dana were the high ornaments. (Cheers.) I look into
your upturned faces as into the faces of old friends. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
I dare not—(A voice: Oh, don’t be afraid, Governor!)—I
dare not take too personally this expression of your
good-will. It is not myself but the great state of South
Carolina that you honour, and on behalf of mine own
people, who have always stood sturdily for the great
principles of the constitution (Cheers); who have failed
in no hour of the country’s need, but have tilled their
fields in peace and defended them in the dark days of
war, I thank you, my friends, with all my heart, again
and again.” (Applause and cheers.)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">What did you say to him?</div>
<div class="verse">What did you say to him?</div>
<div class="indent2"><i>What did who say?</i></div>
<div class="verse">What did the governor of North Carolina</div>
<div class="indent4">SAY</div>
<div class="verse">To the governor of South Carolina?</div>
</div></div>

<p>“On an occasion so purely social as this,” began Governor
Dangerfield, balancing himself lightly upon the
balustrade, “it would be most indelicate for me to discuss
any of the great issues of the day. (A voice: Oh,
I don’t know!) I endorse, with all the strength of my
being, and with all the sincerity of which my heart is
capable, the stirring tribute paid to your noble profession
by my friend, known far and near, and justly known, as
the great reform governor of South Carolina. (Cheers.)
I am proud that the American press is incorruptible.
(Cheers.) Great commercial nation though we be, the
American newspaper—the American newspaper, I say,
is one thing that is never for sale. (Applause and
cheers.) The temptation is strong upon me to take advantage
of this gathering of representative journalists
to speak—not of the fathers of the constitution, not of
Jefferson or Jackson, but of living men and living issues
(Cheers and cries of Let ’er go!); but the hour is late
(A voice: Oh, not on Broadway, William!) and, to
repeat, it would be the height of impropriety—a betrayal
of the bountiful hospitality we have all enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
(A voice: Our lobster was all right. Another voice,
with ironical inflection: <i>This</i> lobster is all right!), a
betrayal, I say, of hospitality for me to do more, gentlemen,
than to thank you, and to say that in your strong
hands the liberties of the people are safe indeed.” (Prolonged
cheering.)</p>

<p>As the correspondents marched away to take the
special train provided for them at Kildare by Ardmore,
they continued to cheer, and they were still demanding,
as long as their cries could be heard at Ardsley:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">What did he say to him?</div>
<div class="verse">What did he say to him?</div>
<div class="indent2"><i>What did who say?</i></div>
<div class="verse">What did the governor of North Carolina</div>
<div class="indent4">SAY</div>
<div class="verse">To the governor of South Carolina?</div>

<p>With a sigh Ardmore left them at the great gates of
Ardsley and returned to the house to find Jerry; but
that young woman was the centre of a wide circle of
admiring militia officers, and the master of Ardsley was
so depressed by the spectacle that he sought a dim
corner of the grounds where there was a stone bench by
a fountain, and there, to his confusion, he beheld Miss
Barbara Osborne and Henry Maine Griswold; and Miss
Osborne, it seemed, was in the act of fastening a white
rose in Professor Griswold’s coat.</p>

<small>GOOD-BYE TO JERRY DANGERFIELD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Ardmore knocked at Griswold’s door
as early as he dared, and went in and talked to his friend
in their old intimate fashion. The associate professor
of admiralty was shaving himself with care.</p>

<p>“You won’t have any hard feelings about that scarlet
fever business, will you, Grissy? It was downright
selfish of me to want to keep the thing to myself, but I
thought it would be fun to go ahead and carry it through
and then show you how well I pulled it off.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ever refer to it again, if you love me,” spluttered
Griswold amiably, as he washed off the lather.
“I, too, have ruled over a kingdom, and I have seen
history in the making, <i>quorum pars magna fui</i>.”</p>

<p>“But I say, Grissy, there is such a thing as fate and
destiny and all that after all; don’t you believe it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I believe it! I know it!” thundered Griswold,
reaching for a towel. He lifted a white rose from
a glass of water where it had spent the night, and regarded
it tenderly. “The right rose under the right
star, and the thing’s done; the rose, the star, and the
girl—the combination simply can’t be beat, Ardy.”</p>

<p>Ardmore seized and wrung his friend’s hand for the
twentieth time; but he was preoccupied, and Griswold,
fastening his collar at the mirror, hummed softly the
couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">With the winking eye</div>
<div class="verse">For my battle-cry.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“Grissy!” shouted Ardmore, “she never did it!”</p>

<p>“Oh—bless my soul, what was I saying! Why, of
course she wasn’t the one! Not Miss Dangerfield—never!”</p>

<p>“Well, you like her, don’t you?” demanded Ardmore
petulantly.</p>

<p>“Of course I like her, you idiot! She’s wonderful.
She’s——”</p>

<p>He frowned upon the scarf he had chosen with much
care, snapped it to shake the wrinkles out, humming
softly, while Ardmore glared at him.</p>

<p>“She’s wise,” Griswold resumed, “with the wisdom
of laughter—accept that, with my compliments. It’s
not often I do so well before breakfast. And now if
you’re to be congratulated before I go back to the
groves of Academe, pray bestir yourself. At this very
moment I have an engagement to walk with a lady
before breakfast—thanks, yes, that’s my coat. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>Breakfast was a lingering affair at Ardsley that morning.
The two governors and the national guard officers
who had spent the night in the house were not in the
slightest hurry to break up the party, for such a company,
they all knew, could hardly be assembled again.
The governors were a trifle nervous as to the attitude
of the press, in spite of Collins’s efforts to dictate what
history should say of the affair on the Raccoon; but
before they left the table the Raleigh morning papers
were brought in, and it was clear that the newspaper
men were keeping their contract.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you, Dangerfield,” said Governor Osborne.
“I only hope that the Columbia and Charleston
papers have done half as well by me.”</p>

<p>Both governors had decided upon an inspection of
such portions of their militia as were assembled on the
Raccoon, and a joint dress parade was appointed for
six o’clock.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>Ardmore, anxious to make every one at home, saw the
morning pass without a chance to speak to Jerry; and
when he was free shortly before noon he was chagrined
to find that she had gone for a ride over the estate with
her father, Governor Osborne, Barbara, and Griswold.
He went in pursuit, and to his delight found her presently
sitting alone on a log by the Raccoon, having dismounted,
it appeared, to rescue a fledgling robin whose
cries had led her away from her companions. She
pointed out the nest, and directed him to climb the
tree and restore the bird. This done, he sat down beside
her at a point where the Raccoon curved sweepingly and
swung off abruptly into a new course.</p>

<p>“I hope your father didn’t scold you for anything we
did,” he began meekly.</p>

<p>“No; he took it all pretty well, and promised that
if I wouldn’t tell mamma what he had been doing—about
coming down here with Governor Osborne just to
settle an old score at poker—mamma doesn’t approve of
cards, you know—that he would make me a present of
a better riding horse than the one I now have, and he
might even consider a trip abroad next summer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t go abroad! It’s—it’s so lonesome
abroad!”</p>

<p>“How perfectly ridiculous! Has it never occurred
to you that I am never lonesome, not even when I’m
alone?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ardmore, who saw that he was headed
for a blind alley, “I’m glad your father was not displeased
with our work.”</p>

<p>“He’ll think we did pretty well after he’s read our
correspondence in his letter books. I told him the
stamp we stamped his name with worked better with
the red ink pad than with the black one, which ought,
at any rate, to be clear enough to a man of papa’s
intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him about that railroad lawyer from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
New York who wanted to suppress the law which compels
all locomotive whistles to be tuned to E flat?”</p>

<p>“No; that man sent me a ten-pound box of candy,
which was highly improper, considering papa’s position,
and I should have scorned to accept the candy, only I
had forgotten to keep his card.”</p>

<p>“And besides,” added Ardmore gently, “you had
eaten the candy. Don’t you remember that you left
nothing but a few burnt almonds which you wanted to
keep for eating filapenas?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly!” ejaculated Jerry contemptuously.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing all this fuss about the Appleweight
people is over, or I should be worse than silly. My mind
was not intended for such heavy work.”</p>

<p>“I think you have a good mind, Mr. Ardmore,” said
Jerry, with the air of one who makes concessions. “You
really did well in all these troubles, and you did much
better than I thought you would the day I hired you for
private secretary. I think I could safely recommend
you to any governor in need of assistance.”</p>

<p>“You talk as though you were getting ready to discharge
me,” said Ardmore plaintively, “and I don’t
want to lose my job.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have something to do,” said Jerry
thoughtfully. “As near as I can make out you have
never done anything but study about pirates and collect
pernicious books on the sinful life of Captain Kidd.
You should have some larger aim in life than that, and
I think I know of a good position that is now open,
or will be as soon as papa has cleared out the peanut
shells we left in his desk. I think you would make an
excellent adjutant-general with full charge of the state
militia. You have already had experience in the handling
of troops, and as Rutherford Gillingwater never did
anything but get typhoid fever to earn the place, I see
no reason why papa should not appoint you to the
position.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“But you have to get rid of Gillingwater first,” suggested
Ardmore, his heart beating fast.</p>

<p>“If you mean that he has to be removed from office, I
will tell you now, Mr. Ardmore, that Rutherford Gillingwater
will no longer sign himself adjutant-general of
North Carolina. I removed him myself in a general
order I wrote yesterday afternoon just before I told
papa that you and I could not act as governor any
longer, but that he must resume the yoke.”</p>

<p>“But that must have been a matter of considerable
delicacy, Miss Dangerfield, when you consider that you
are engaged to marry Mr. Gillingwater.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” said Jerry. “I broke our engagement
the moment I saw that he came here the other
night all dressed up to eat and not to fight, and he is
now free to engage himself to that thin blonde at Goldsboro
whom he thinks so highly intellectual.”</p>

<p>Jerry held up her left hand and regarded its ringless
fingers judicially, while Ardmore, his heart racing hotly
against all records, watched her, and with a particular
covetousness his eyes studied that trifle of a hand.</p>

<p>Then with a quick gesture he seized her hand and
raised her gently to her feet.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” he cried. “From the moment you winked
at me I have loved you. I should have followed you
round the world until I found you. If you can marry a
worthless wretch like me, if—O Jerry!”</p>

<p>She gently freed her hand and stepped to one side,
bending her head like a bird that pauses alarmed, or
uncertain of its whereabouts, glancing cautiously up and
down the creek.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore,” she said, “you may not be aware
that when you asked me to be your wife—and that, I
take it, was your intention—you were standing in South
Carolina, while I stood with both feet on the sacred soil
of the Old North State. Under the circumstances I do
not think your proposal is legal. Moreover, unless you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
are quite positive which eye it was that so far forgot
itself as to wink, I do not think the matter can go
further.”</p>

<p>The slightest suggestion of a smile played about her
lips, but he was very deeply troubled, and seeing this,
her eyes grew grave with kindness.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ardmore, if your muscles of locomotion have not
been utterly paralyzed, and if you will leave that particular
state of the Union which, next to Massachusetts,
I most deeply abhor, I will do what I can in my poor
weak way—as father says in beginning his best speeches—to
assist you to the answer.”</p>

<p>Then for many æons, when he had his arms about her,
a kiss, which he had intended for the lips that were so
near, somehow failed of its destination, and fell upon
what seemed to him a rose-leaf gone to Heaven, but
which was, in fact, Jerry Dangerfield’s left eye. His
being tingled with the most delicious of intoxications,
to which the clasp of her arms about his neck added
unnecessary though not unwelcome delight. Then she
drew back and held him away with her finger-tips for
an instant.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thomas Ardmore,” she said, with maddening
deliberation, “it may not be important, but I must tell
you in all candour that it was the other eye.”</p>
